[appendix]

== Appendix

The appendixes are not always considered part of the actual SRS and are not always necessary. 

.They may include
.. Sample input/output formats, descriptions of cost analysis studies, or results of user surveys;
.. Supporting or background information that can help the readers of the SRS; 
.. A description of the problems to be solved by the software;
.. Special packaging instructions for the code and the media to meet security, export, initial loading, or other requirements.

When appendixes are included, the SRS should explicitly state whether or not the appendixes are to be considered part of the requirements.
