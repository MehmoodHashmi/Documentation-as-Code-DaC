[.underline]#*_Write AI-Detector-free content with the help of Chat-GPT_*#
#Given below is starter prompt#

1. I want you to rewrite a few sentences for me in the human voice. Do you understand?

2. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, *"perplexity" and "burstiness."* Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, compares the variations of sentences.  Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?

3. *Prompt:* using the concepts written previously, rewrite #[this article]# with a high degree of *"perplexity and burstiness."*
						OR
4. *Prompt:* Using the concepts written previously, rewrite #[the sentences]# given below with a high degree of *"perplexity and burstiness."*


5. *Sentences:* [#Write your sentences or paragraph here.#]

Estimating project cost and time can be challenging, especially if you're new to freelancing. Here are some general tips that may help:

[arabic]
. Break down the project into smaller tasks: Before estimating the cost and time, try to break down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will help you get a better idea of the amount of work required for each task.
. Estimate the time required for each task: Once you have broken down the project into smaller tasks, estimate the time required for each task. Be realistic and take into account any potential roadblocks or challenges you may face.
. Determine your hourly rate: To estimate the cost, you need to determine your hourly rate. Consider your level of experience, the complexity of the project, and the market rate for similar projects when setting your rate.
. Calculate the cost for each task: Once you know your hourly rate and the estimated time required for each task, you can calculate the cost for each task by multiplying the hourly rate by the estimated time.
. Add up the costs for all tasks: After calculating the cost for each task, add them up to get the total cost of the project.
. Include a buffer: It's always a good idea to include a buffer in your estimate to account for unexpected delays or revisions. This buffer can be a percentage of the total project cost, depending on the size and complexity of the project.
. Communicate your estimate clearly: When presenting your estimate to your clients, make sure to communicate it clearly and in writing. Include a breakdown of the costs for each task and the estimated timeline for the project.

Remember that estimating project cost and time is not an exact science, and it's normal to revise your estimate as the project progresses. Be transparent with your clients and communicate any changes or delays as soon as possible.

====
If a client insists for the cost and time,
without providing a project scope,
then tell them that I have completed the project ranging 500$ to 40000$ in this category lasting for 10-day to 3-months.
