*:There are **"objective and subjective"** colour **influences**. I was pointing more towards the objective but I didn't mention the cultural and subjective differences in perceived colour, for example, blue the colour of the sky is naturally programmed
into the mind to be an inviting and calming colour. As it's a colour our mind has evolved to put in the background and somewhat ignore while more important colour information could be happening Infront of us. There are objective instinctual emotions and
reactions-tied to colour, though through life experiences and culture these can be shifted and changed. But in general, you need to keep these things in mind when using colour. As well
as keeping in mind the culture and subjective meaning from the audiences viewing whatever it is you make;

*[#darkblue] <i>Color Theory
**[#lightblue] <i> Definition
***[#white] <i><size:14>**Color theory** is the study of how colors interact and the principles that govern their use in art, design, and various applications. It explores the relationships between colors and their effects on visual perception.

**[#lightblue] <i>Primary Colors\n<img:images/img_1.png{scale=.5}>
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Red**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Red is one of the three primary colors. It is **bold and intense,** often associated with **passion and energy.**

***[#green] <i><color #white>**Saturation**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Saturation determines the **intensity or vividness (clarity, distinctness or brightness)** of a color.\n<img:images/img_23.png{scale=.4}>
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Value (Brightness) **\n<i><size:12><color #white>**Or Tint/Shades**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Value represents how **light (white or tint) or dark (black or shade) a color appears.**\n<img:images/img_24.png{scale=.4}>

**[#lightblue] <i><size:18>Color Schemes (or Groups)
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #orange>**"Color Schemes are applied" only when you have "chosen" the "first color"**

****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Monochromatic color schemes use variations of a single hue for a **harmonious (coordinated, friendly or matching) look.**
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Analogous** \n<img:images/img_11.png{scale=.35}>
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Analogous color schemes use colors that are adjacent on the color wheel for a pleasing and coordinated effect.
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Complementary** \n<img:images/img_4.png{scale=.45}>
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Complementary color schemes involve **colors opposite each other** on the **color wheel for contrast.**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Example**\n<img:images/img_5.png{scale=.5}>
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Split-Complementary**\n<img:images/img_6.png{scale=.55}>
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Split-complementary schemes are variations of the complementary scheme, using two adjacent colors along with the complement.
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Example**\n<img:images/img_7.png{scale=.5}>
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Triadic**\n<img:images/img_8.png{scale=.5}>
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Triadic color schemes use three evenly spaced colors on the color wheel for a balanced look.
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Example**\n<img:images/img_9.png{scale=.5}>
***[#green] <i><color #white>**Double Complementary**\n<img:images/img_10.png{scale=.55}>
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Mostly used in **"kids products",** usually try avoiding this color scheme, avoid because simplicity is better & it has many colors
