* Data Cube
** Definition
*** <size:14>A data cube is a multi-dimensional database or data structure that allows for the efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of data with multiple dimensions.

**[#gold] Objectives
*** Multi-Dimensional Analysis
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Facilitate analysis across multiple dimensions, such as time, geography, and product.
*** Aggregation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Precompute and store aggregated values for faster query responses.
***[#orange] ====**Support for OLAP**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Enable Online Analytical Processing **(OLAP)** for complex data analysis.

**[#pink] ====Data Cube Components
*** **Dimensions**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Independent attributes or categories by which data is analyzed.
*** Measures
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Numeric values or facts to be analyzed.
*** Hierarchies
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Organizational structures within dimensions for more detailed analysis.
*** Aggregates
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Precomputed summary values to speed up queries.

**[#a] Data Cube Models
*** ====**Star Schema**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A model with one central fact table and related dimension tables.
***[#red] ====**[[../../../Apache-Big-Data-Ecosystem/Snowflake.puml Snowflake Schema]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A normalized version of the star schema with additional sub-dimensions.
***[#black] ====**[[../../../../books/1-books-backlog/DBMS/Dimensional-Modeling.puml Multidimensional Model]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A model that directly represents data as a cube with dimensions.

** Data Cube Tools
*** OLAP Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Online Analytical Processing tools like Microsoft Analysis Services and IBM Cognos.
*** ====**Data Warehouses**
****[#black] ====<size:14>**Platforms like [[../../../Apache-Big-Data-Ecosystem/Snowflake.puml Snowflake]] and [[../../../../cloud-computing/AWS-Cloud/Amazon-Redshift.puml Amazon Redshift,]] for data cube storage.**
*** Business Intelligence **(BI)** Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tools such as Tableau and Power BI for data cube visualization.

**[#lightgreen] Considerations
*** Data Volume
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Plan for data cube storage requirements, especially for large datasets.
*** Dimension Hierarchies
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define hierarchies within dimensions to enable more detailed analysis.
*** Data Updates
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Consider how data updates are handled within the data cube.

*** Query Performance
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Optimize the data cube for query performance and response times.

** Best Practices
*** Dimension Design
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Carefully design dimensions to support meaningful analysis.
*** Aggregation Strategies
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Select appropriate aggregation methods for improved query performance.
*** Data Cubes Documentation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Document the data cube structure, hierarchies, and measures.
*** Query Optimization
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Optimize queries for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
