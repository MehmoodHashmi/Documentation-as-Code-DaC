* =DataOps
** Definition
*** <i><size:20>**DataOps** combines **principles, practices, and technologies** to improve the **efficiency, reliability, and quality** of **data operations.**
**[#gold] =Key Components
***[#pink] <i>**Collaboration**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Cross-functional collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders.
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Collaboration tools like version control, issue tracking, and documentation platforms.
***[#orange] <i>**Automation**
****[#white] <i><size:14>**Automated workflows for __data ingestion, transformation, quality assurance, and deployment__.**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Integration of CI/CD **(Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** practices.
*** Monitoring and Observability
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Real-time monitoring of data pipelines, data quality, and system health.
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Centralized logging, alerts, and dashboards for visibility into data operations.
***[#pink] <i>**Quality Assurance**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Data validation and testing to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
****[#darkorange] <i><size:14>Use of **[[docs/AI-ML-DL-Data-Science-and-BigData/data-science/data-engineering/Data-Profiling.puml data profiling]],** data lineage, and data quality frameworks.
