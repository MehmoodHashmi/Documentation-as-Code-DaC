* Batch Ingestion
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Batch ingestion** is a data ingestion process that collects and transfers data from various sources in predefined, periodic batches.

**[#a] Objectives
*** Data Collection
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Gather data from diverse sources, such as databases, logs, files, and external systems.
*** Data Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Process and transform data during batch ingestion.
*** Scheduling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Execute ingestion tasks at scheduled intervals **(e.g., daily, hourly)**.

**[#lime] Batch Ingestion Techniques
***[#red] ===**[[../../data-or-database-migration/Data-Migration-Strategies/ETL-(Extract-Transform-Load)-Strategy.puml ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Tools]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Extract data from source systems, apply transformations, and load it into a data storage or processing system.
***[#blue] ===**[[data-pipeline.puml Data Pipelines]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define **data pipelines** to move and process data through a series of predefined steps.
***[#white] ===Data Loading
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Load batch data into a **data warehouse or data lake** for analysis.

** Batch Ingestion Tools
*** Apache Nifi
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>An open-source data integration tool for building data flows and **ETL processes.**
*** Apache Spark
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A distributed data processing framework for batch processing and analytics.
*** AWS Glue
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A managed **ETL service **for ingesting, transforming, and loading data.

**[#a] Considerations
*** Data Sources
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identify source systems and understand data formats.
*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define and implement data transformations during batch processing.
*** Scheduling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Set up ingestion schedules that align with business needs.

*** Error Handling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Plan for error detection, logging, and recovery during batch ingestion.

** Best Practices
*** Data Profiling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Profile source data to understand data characteristics.
*** Data Validation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Implement data validation checks to ensure data quality.
*** Data Backups
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Maintain backups of batch data in case of issues or data loss.
*** Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Set up monitoring and alerting to detect and address batch processing problems.
