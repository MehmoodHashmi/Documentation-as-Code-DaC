* Advanced Data Stream

** Stream Processing
*** Definition
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Continuous processing of data records as they arrive
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Enables real-time analytics and immediate response to data

*** Techniques
****[#yellow] ===<size:14>Windowing
***** Divides the data stream into finite, overlapping or non-overlapping time intervals for analysis
***** **Examples:** Tumbling windows, sliding windows

****[#yellow] ===<size:14>Joining and Aggregation
***** Combines multiple data streams based on shared attributes or keys
***** Performs aggregation operations on the combined data
***** **Examples:** Joining customer data with sales data, computing sum or average

****[#yellow] ===<size:14>Complex Event Processing (CEP)
***** Identifies patterns and correlations in the data stream
***** Allows detection of complex events or situations
***** **Examples:** Fraud detection, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance
