* Batch Processing
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Batch processing** is the practice of processing and analyzing data in predefined, periodic batches, typically suited for large volumes of data.

**[#gold] <i>Objectives
*** Data Analysis
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Perform data analysis and generate insights from collected data.
*** Report Generation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Create reports, summaries, and aggregated data for decision-making.
*** Resource Efficiency
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Optimize resource usage by processing data in bulk.

**[#pink] <i> Batch Processing Steps
*** Data Collection
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Gather data from various sources, such as databases, files, and APIs.
*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Apply transformations to clean, format, and structure the data.
*** Data Analysis
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Analyze data, perform calculations, and extract meaningful information.
*** Report Generation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Generate reports, charts, and summaries for users.

** Batch Processing Tools
*** ETL **(Extract, Transform, Load)**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Tools like Talend, Apache Nifi, and Informatica for batch data processing.
*** Data Warehousing Platforms
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Solutions like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.
*** Big Data Processing Frameworks
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop for large-scale batch processing.

**[#orange] <i>Considerations
*** Data Volume
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Plan for handling large data volumes efficiently.
*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Design and implement data transformations to prepare data for analysis.
*** Scalability
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Ensure batch processing can scale to accommodate growing data.

*** Error Handling
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Develop error detection, logging, and recovery mechanisms.

** Best Practices
***[#black] <b><i><size:14>[[docs/AI-ML-DL-Data-Science-and-BigData/data-science/data-engineering/Data-Profiling.puml Data Profiling]]
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Understand source data characteristics and quality for effective processing.
*** Workflow Automation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Automate batch processing workflows for consistency and efficiency.
*** Data Quality Checks
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Implement data quality checks to ensure the integrity of processed data.
*** Monitoring and Alerting
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Set up monitoring and alerting to detect and address processing issues.
