*[#darkblue] <i>Data Ingestion
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Definition
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>**Data ingestion** is the process of **collecting, importing, and transferring data** from **various sources into a data storage or processing system** for analysis or storage.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Objectives
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Collect Data
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Gather data from diverse sources, such as **databases, logs, files, and external APIs.**
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Ensure Data Availability
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Make data accessible for analysis and decision-making.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Maintain Data Freshness
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Keep data up to date to support real-time or near-real-time analysis.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:18>Data Ingestion Techniques
***[#green] <i><size:14>**[[Batch-Ingestion.puml Batch Ingestion]]**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Collect and transfer **data** periodically in predefined batches.
***[#green] <i><size:14>**[[Stream-Ingestion.puml Stream Ingestion]]**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Process and move **data** in real-time or near-real-time streams.
***[#green] <i><size:14>**[[Change-Data-Capture-(CDC).puml Change Data Capture (CDC)]]**
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Capture and replicate changes made to **data** sources in real-time.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Data Ingestion Tools
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Apache Nifi
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>An open-source **data** integration tool for routing and transforming data.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Kafka
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>A distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>AWS Glue
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>A managed ETL service for ingesting and preparing data.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:18>Considerations
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Data Sources
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Identify and connect to various data sources, including databases, files, and APIs.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Data Transformation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Determine whether data should be transformed during ingestion or after.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Scalability
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Ensure the ingestion process can handle growing data volumes.

***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Data Security
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Protect data during ingestion with encryption and access controls.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Best Practices
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Data Profiling
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Understand source data to prepare for ingestion.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Data Validation
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Implement validation checks to verify data integrity.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Error Handling
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Plan for handling errors and exceptions during ingestion.
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Monitoring
****[#yellow] <i><size:14>Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and address issues.
