* =Categories of \n=Data & Learning
**:Unlabeled data typically falls under the category of "Unsupervised Learning" in the context of machine learning.
Unsupervised learning is a type of learning where the data does not have predefined labels or categories. The goal
is to explore the patterns, relationships, or structures within the data without any specific guidance.;
** Labeled Data
***[#pink] **Supervised Learning**
**** **Classification**
***** **Output** is always **__category__<color #crimson>__ or label__</color> (is non-numeric value)**\n<img:images/img_54.png>
****** **Target variable** are always **Nominal or Ordinal data/variable** \n* __**Target variable** is always **dependent**__\n** Pick target variable after you 've applied the **__correlation step__** & 've removed the irrelevant variables\n*** Picking target variable without performing the correlation step produces errors or bad results \n**** Previous two steps are related to Data-Engineering or data cleaning, Use **Heatmap graph for correlation**\n* __**Independent variables** are called **"variables or features"**__ \n* __**Dependent variable** often called **"target or outcome"**__\n* Model **"accuracy"** can be determined \n<img:images/img_46.png>
******* **As shown below**\n <img:images/img_43.png>

***** __Problem conversion__ from __regression__ \nto __classification__ or vice versa
****** What should be the thought process?
*******:* What is the problem that I'm trying to solve? Identification of problem
* Which thing am I trying to determine?
** Do I've the necessary data for the thing I'm trying to determine?
*** If yes, then go ahead and solve the problem.
*** Otherwise, determine the reason for why don't you 've the necessary data
**** Based on the reason you 've identified you will change your data-set **OR**
        you will change your problem from __regression to classification__ or from
        classification to regression as per demand.;
****** =Example
*******:Let say you 've to predict the temperature. And predicting the temperature I think
is regression problem, because the temperature is interval data and it can be 20, 30, or
50 celsius. But I think my regression model will not work nicely on this model, So I will
divide the temperature data into 3-classes (low, medium & high) temperature.
* low temperature = 1-15 celsius
* medium temperature = 16-30 celsius
* high temperature = 36-50 celsius

Notice carefully earlier my problem was a regression problem and now it had become a
classification problem. So for my convenience I had molded the data in a different
manner and resultantly made it a classification problem.;


**** **Regression**
***** **Output** is always **Numeric value**
****** **Target variable** are always **interval or ratio data/variable** \n* __**Target variable** is always **dependent**__\n** Pick target variable after you 've applied the **__correlation step__** & 've removed the irrelevant variables\n*** Picking target variable without performing the correlation step produces errors or bad results \n**** Previous two steps are related to Data-Engineering or data cleaning, Use **Heatmap graph for correlation**\n* __**Independent variables** are called **"variables or features"**__ \n* __**Dependent variable** often called **"target or outcome"**__\n* Model **"accuracy"** can't be determined \n<img:images/img_46.png>

* The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a common evaluation metric used in regression tasks.
* It measures the **average squared difference* between the actual and predicted values.
* There are few more types of (MSE), which are used based on the need

* **Answer#1** Reasons for high (MSE) can be like **"Not performing the __data preprocessing__ step"**
* **Answer#2** To lower the (MSE) perform **data preprocessing** step carefully

**:This updated mindmap script reflects the distinction between labeled data used in supervised learning tasks and unlabeled data used
in unsupervised learning tasks. Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover patterns, groupings, or anomalies in the data without
relying on predefined labels.;

*:The distinction between labeled and unlabeled data is primarily used in the field of machine learning, where it plays a crucial role
in the training and development of models. However, the concept of labeled and unlabeled data can also be relevant in other disciplines
that involve data analysis and pattern recognition. Here are a few examples:

* **Data Mining:** Data mining is a field that focuses on discovering patterns, relationships, and insights from large datasets.
In data mining, labeled data is often used for supervised learning tasks, while unlabeled data can be utilized for
unsupervised learning tasks such as clustering or anomaly detection.

* **Statistics:** In statistics, labeled data is commonly used for statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
**__Unlabeled data__,** on the other hand, can be explored using techniques like **exploratory data analysis or clustering** to gain insights
into the underlying structure of the data.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** In NLP, labeled data is often required for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition,
or text classification. Unlabeled data can be utilized for tasks such as topic modeling or word embeddings, where the goal is to uncover
latent patterns or representations in text.

While the terminology may vary across disciplines, the fundamental idea of distinguishing between labeled and unlabeled data remains
applicable in various fields that involve data analysis, modeling, and pattern recognition.;
