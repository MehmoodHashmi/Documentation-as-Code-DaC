*[#red] =Lecture-5 Part-2: **The Addition Rule for Probability**
** =we have transitioned from __descriptive statistics to inferential statistics__


* =Compound Event:
** An event that joins tow or more simple events, or when you are looking for two or more simple events.

* =//__Addition Rule for Probability__//\n<img:images/img_8.png{scale=.7}> \n=__In a single trial__
** =//Definition://
*** Probability of 'A' occurring or 'B' occurring or both A and B occurring <size:22>__in a single trial__
** =//OR:// means one or the other  or both
*** =//OR:// implies addition (+), in Probability
** =//Example-1:// \nProbability of rolling **a 1 OR a 5** <size:22>__in a single trial__ \n<img:images/img_9.png{scale=.7}>
***:=//both __simple events__ (1,5) are __mutually exclusive__//
* **mutually exclusive** means it can't happen so that both (1,5) occur in a single trial;
** =//Example-2:// \nProbability of blond OR female <size:22>__in a single trial__\n=example-3\n<img:images/img_10.png{scale=.7}>
*** =//both __simple events__ (blond, female) are __not mutually exclusive__ //
*** Only in such cases we get **"double count"**, so we have to eliminate it through subtracting <size:22>P(A intersection B)



* =//Disjoint events// \n<img:images/img_11.png{scale=.7}>
** just another way to say <size:22>**mutually exclusive, __events__**</size> that can't happen at the same time
*** =//Non-Disjoint events// \n<img:images/img_12.png{scale=.7}>

* =Complementary events\n<img:images/img_13.png{scale=.7}>
