*:== //__**Science**__// knows only two kinds of processes in nature <color:lime>deterministic</color> and <color:crimson>random (non-deterministic) processes</color> and __combination of these two results in <color:brown>**probabilistic processes**__.
= <color:crimson>Randomness (non-determinism) and probability</color> are not freedom. They mean I can't predict your actions with 100% accuracy because there's randomness.
= **Technology** is never <color:red>deterministic.</color> You can't build paradise or hell with these technologies. Because they don't have just one type of usage.

* **Deterministic Processes:** These are processes in which the outcomes are entirely determined by initial conditions and governing laws or equations. There is no inherent randomness or uncertainty in deterministic processes.

* **Random Processes:** Random processes are those in which outcomes involve an element of randomness or unpredictability. The behavior of such processes cannot be precisely predicted; instead, it follows probability distributions.

* **Probabilistic Processes:** Probabilistic processes, as you mentioned, result from a combination of deterministic and random elements. In these processes, outcomes are described using probabilities, which reflect both
    the deterministic and random aspects of the system.

This distinction is fundamental in various scientific fields, helping researchers understand and model the behavior of natural phenomena. Deterministic processes are common in classical physics, while random or
probabilistic processes play a significant role in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and various other branches of science.;

*[#red] =Lecture-4 Part-1: **Introduction to Probability**
** =we have transitioned from __descriptive statistics to inferential statistics__


*:I've studied probability and statistics without experiencing them. What's the difference? What are they trying to do?

  This analogy helped:

=//__**Probability**__// is starting with an animal, and figuring out what footprints it will make.
=//__**Statistics**__// is seeing a footprint, and guessing the animal.

**Probability** is a forward-looking process. It helps in predicting the next output given our knowledge of the distribution of the data
generating model which is a random process

**:<size:22>**Probability is straightforward:**</size> you have the <size:22>bear.</size> **Measure the foot size, the leg length,** and you
can <size:22>deduce the footprints.</size> "Oh, Mr. Bubbles weighs 400lbs and has 3-foot legs, and will make tracks like this." More
academically: "We have a fair coin. After 10 flips, here are the possible outcomes."

<size:22>**Statistics is harder.**</size> <size:22>We measure the **footprints**</size> and have to <size:22>guess what animal it could be.
A bear? A human? If we get 6 heads and 4 tails, what're the chances of a fair coin?;

* = basic vocabulary for inferential statistics


* =Probability
** ===it is the basis for making decisions about our data, that's really what we will be doing
** =Definition:
*** likelihood of an event occurring
*** low probability = **rare/un-usual** occurrences
****[#pink] =Probabilities are always between 0 and 1.
*****[#gold] =Probability = 0
****** =Impossible Event
*****[#lime] =Probability = 1
****** =Certain Event
***[#red] =3-Types of Probability
**** =1- Observed Probability
*****:__Probability__ that is **estimated** based on your **observation**, when you actually do something.
*What **did happen** when you flipped the coin
====
== [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2eomv6XfWo&ab_channel=PhysicsVideosbyEugeneKhutoryansky The more a procedure is repeated, the closer observed probability will get to the classical probability]] YouTube Video 20-minute;

***** **Example:** I flip the coin 100 or 1000 times, but I cannot flip the coin infinitely, so flipping the coin \n100-times makes sure that there are good amount of outcomes.\n**Formula:**\n<img:images/img_4.png{scale=.7}>\n <size:22>**Where "A" is an __event__**
**** =2- Classical Probability
***** __Probability__ based on **chance** of an **event** occurring, (each sample event must have an equal chance of occurring) \n*What **should happen** when you flip the coin every time,
***** *Here you are just **thinking** about it that this **should happen not actually doing it** \n**Formula:** \n<img:images/img_5.png{scale=.7}>\n <size:22>**Where "A" is an __event__**
**** =3- Subjective Probability
***** **Definition:** If someone **estimated** based on **educated guess**
***** =like doctors do; they tell 25% chance of cancer recovery,\n=50% chance of operation success, etc.


* =Event
** =A collection of outcomes of a procedure \n<img:images/img.png{scale=.7}>

* =Procedure
** =Definition
*** What you are doing
** =Example
*** flip a coin 1 time, flip a coin 3 time, roll a die 1 time, roll a die 2 time


* =Simple Event
** a single outcome
** <size:22>For example,</size> the probability of getting a <size:22>**3**</size> when a <size:22>**die**</size> is tossed. In the case of a **simple event,** the numerator (number of favourable outcomes) will be <size:22>**1**</size> .

* =Sample Space
** all __simple events__ OR **all/every** __possible outcomes__

*:<img:images/img_1.png{scale=.7}>
<img:images/img_2.png{scale=.7}>
# **Procedure:** what you are doing
# **Event:** what you are looking for
# **Simple Event**: what you will eventually get
# **Sample Space**: is a collection of simple events

When you flipped the coin **3 times,** and you were looking for **1-H and 2-T** event. There
are **3-ways** through which this **event** (what you are looking for) can be **accomplished,**
but there are **8-simple events** that can occur;


* =//Law of Large Numbers//
* =//Complementary Events//
** Two events which are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can't be at different sets at the same time, more prcisely you can't wear shoes and sandel at the same time

* =//Complement//
** The complement of **event** <size:22>**"A"**</size> is denoted by
*** <img:images/img_6.png{scale=.7}> and is all the outcomes when **event** <size:22>**"A"**</size> __does not occur__.
**:=Example
* **event:** rolling a 5
* **complement:** not rolling a 5
** <size:22>{1,2,3,4,6}</size>;
*** <img:images/img_7.png{scale=.7}>\n <size:22>The __probability of an event plus the probability of the complement__ must be equal to **1**
