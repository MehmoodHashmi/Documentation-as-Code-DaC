*[#orange] =Lecture-1 Part-1: **The-Key-Words-and-Definitions-For-Elementary-Statistics**
* =**Data**
** =When we are talking about the __**data**__ in this class (statistics lectures) that means <color #green>**observations**</color>
** **Definition:** Any <size:22><color #green>**observations**</color> </size> that have been __collected__

* =**Statistics**
** =Collect data
***[#pink] You have to collect the data appropriately, so that your data is not **biased data**
***:*If you Collect data and do not know what to do with it, then it's **wasted time and useless data.**
*Why? because you don't know **how to  analyze, interpret and draw conclusions from data.**
*__Then collected data does not matter at all and data itself does not matter.__;

** =Analyze data
** =Interpret data
**[#red] =And draw conclusions from data

* =**Population**
** Complete set of all elements to be studied (OR being studied)
** **Is it necessary to study __each element__ of the <size:22>"set"? No**

*[#pink] =**Parameter and statistic**
** **Parameter:** Characteristic (trait) of a **Population**
** **Statistic:** Characteristic (trait) of a **Sample**
**:**Example:** These two **(parameter and statistic) could be talking about the same thing.** It just depends on what **group (population or sample)** you are referring.
E.g. if you find out that everybody's hair color in America is blond then it's **parameter**, everybody's hair color is blond. This will be characteristic of entire population.
__But if you take a **sample** from the **population** and then talk those **characteristics** then we refer them as **statistics**__;

* =**Sample**
** is generally smaller than **population** OR **sample** is some subset of the **population**
**[#pink] **Statistics** generally deals with the **samples**
***[#pink] **Population** is usually too big or huge for you to get any information in a timely manner
***[#pink] Your **sample** must be **random** so that it is not **biased data**. In other words, when you collect data make sure that you collect it randomly

* **Consensus**
** is collecting from **every member** of a **population**
**[#pink] **Statistics** generally deals with the **samples**
***[#pink] **Population** is usually too big or huge for you to get any information in a timely manner

**[#gold] ==**1. Qualitative Data (is <color #crimson>__categorical__</color>)** \n<img:images/img_38.png{scale=.99}> \nUse your <size:22>**senses** (internal & external)</size> \nto observe results
*** **Definition:** Data that is **Non-Numeric**

***[#pink] =Imbalance Data
****[#pink] <color #black><b>The term __Imbalance Data__ (or Imbalanced Classes) is used when \n<b><color #black>you are working with __categorical data__ or (non-numeric data)
*****[#yellow] **e.g.** When "Data" available related to "oranges" is more than "apples & grapes"
*****[#yellow] Imbalance Data is never left or right skewed, its irrelevant to talk about skewness
*** **Examples:** Gender, Color, Race, Religion, Ethnicity, Army Rank, Zip Code (some **data** like **zip code** might have numbers in them but still they are **Quantitative**)
*** **Math operations** are **meaningless on Qualitative data** (or categorical data), \nyou can't add, subtract, multiply, divide qualitative data
****[#red] =**Examples**
***** **Nominal data**
***** **Ordinal data**
***[#orange] **Color Palettes**
****[#white] **Categorical**
*****[#yellow] ===**Qualitative or categorical palettes are the best suitable to plot the categorical data as follows:**\n<img:images/img_55.png{scale=.4}>
*****[#pink] ===When to use:

*****:=__Number Theory:__
* <size:22>**Real Numbers**
** <size:16>**__Rational numbers__**
*** Integers **{...,-3, -2, -1, <color:crimson>0,</color> 1, 2, 3,...}**
**** Whole numbers e.g. {**<color:crimson>0,</color>** 1, 2, 3,...}
***** Natural numbers e.g. {1, 2, 3, ...}
** <size:16>**__Irrational numbers__**;
****** <img:images/img_50.png{scale=.7}>
******* <img:images/img_52.png{scale=.7}>
********:These different types of numbers fall under the broader category of mathematics and specifically number theory and mathematical analysis. Here's how these number types are categorized:

         1. **Natural Numbers (N)**: These are the positive whole numbers starting from 1 (1, 2, 3, ...). They are a fundamental concept in elementary mathematics.

         2. **Integers (Z)**: Integers include all positive whole numbers (natural numbers), all negative whole numbers, and zero (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
         Integers are used in various mathematical contexts, including algebra and number theory.

         3. **Rational Numbers (Q)**: Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers where the denominator is not zero. They include integers and fractions
         (e.g., -3, 1/2, 3.75). Rational numbers are a fundamental concept in elementary mathematics.

         4. **Irrational Numbers**: Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as fractions of two integers. Examples include the square root of 2 (√2), pi (π), and the mathematical constant e.
          They are studied in both number theory and mathematical analysis.

         5. **Real Numbers (R)**: Real numbers include both rational and irrational numbers. They represent all possible points on the number line. Real numbers are a central concept in **real**
         **analysis, calculus,** and other branches of mathematics.

         6. **Complex Numbers (C)**: Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part (a + bi), where "a" and "b" are real numbers, and "i" is the imaginary unit (√(-1)). Complex
          numbers are studied in complex analysis and are used extensively in various mathematical and scientific fields, including engineering and physics.

         So, while these numbers are fundamental to mathematics as a whole, they have their own subtopics and areas of study within mathematics, ranging from elementary arithmetic (natural
         numbers) to advanced topics like complex analysis (complex numbers).;

***[#pink] =Skewness
****[#pink] <size:14><i><color #black>**The term __Skewness__ is used when** **you are working with __numeric data__**
*****[#yellow] **Left skewed**
*****[#yellow] **Right skewed**
*****[#yellow] **Normally distributed**
*****[#yellow] **IQR**
*** **Examples:** Height, weight, wages, MPH (miles per hour), Temperature, Time
*** **Math operations** are **meaningful on Quantitative data**, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide **quantitative data**
****[#red] =**Examples**
***** **Interval data**
***** **Ratio data**
***[#lime] ==**2-Types of Quantitative Data**
****[#yellow] ==1. Discrete Data
***** **Definition:** **Countable OR finite** (meaning there are only certain number of elements/values you can pick from)
***** **Example:** does a chicken lays half eggs, would you like to buy half washing machines, rolling a dice, etc.
***** Usually a <size:18>**count**
*****[#orange] **Color Palettes**
******[#white] **Categorical**
*******[#yellow] ===**Qualitative or categorical palettes are the best suitable to plot the categorical data as follows:**\n<img:images/img_55.png{scale=.4}>
*******[#pink] ===When to use:
********[#yellow] Discrete or qualitative data with no natural ordering


****[#yellow] ==2. Continuous Data
***** **Definition:** **Infinite number of values or elements** (not countable)
***** **Example:** Temperature, Length, etc.
***** Usually a <size:16>**__Measurement__**\n<img:images/img_33.png{scale=.98}>
****** Measurements are not easy, depends on tool the used and how specific you want to be
****** **Measurements** are made with instruments such as rulers, balances, graduated cylinders,\n breakers, and thermometers, these results are **measurable. numbers**
*****[#orange] ===**Color Palettes**
******[#gold] ===**Continuous or** \n===**Sequential**
*******[#yellow] **Sequential plots are suitable to express the distribution of data** \n**ranging from relative lower values to higher values within a range.** \n<img:images/img_56.png{scale=.4}>
*******[#pink] ===When to use:
********[#yellow] Continuous data with a natural ordering, with a clear progression

******[#gold] ===**Diverging**
*******[#yellow] **Diverging palettes use two different colors. Each color represents variation in the value ranging from a common point in either direction.** \n* **We assume plotting the data ranging from -1 to 1. The values from -1 to 0 takes one color and 0 to +1 takes another color.** \n<img:images/img_57.png{scale=.5}> \nDiverging color palettes are good for continuous data with a meaningful middle point. This is because diverging palettes are designed to show deviations from a central value, which is typically \nrepresented by a neutral color in the middle of the palette. The two ends of the palette are then used to represent values that are above or below the central value, with darker colors typically \nrepresenting larger deviations.


*******[#pink] ===When to use:
********[#yellow] Continuous data with a meaningful middle point

is all about describing your data. To do this we firstly describe the spread of the data using the range and interquartile range.
Then we might look at the central tendency of the data using the mean, median and mode. We might also describe the variability using
the standard deviation and variance.
= And of course we want to visualise the data using graphs and plots. Selecting the right plot and graph might seem difficult
= but it is really quite easy when you think about the __two most important types of variables.__

= <color #crimson>**Categorical**</color> and <color #lime>**numeric**</color> variables.
* <size:18>A **__single categorical variable__** is usually represented with a **bar chart or bar plot.**
* <size:18>A **__single numerical variable__** is visualized with a **histogram or box plot (or boxplot).**
* <size:18>For **__two numerics__** we use a **scatter plot** and and so on.

This video will talk you through all of the combinations of variables, and how to create graphics that really talk to your audience.
If you're interested in data science and quantitative analysis, then this video is for you. If you are a beginner and want to learn
about statistics and how to work with data, then you'll love this video. This video is good for those learning data science but also
anyone wanting to learn about research methods for a masters degree of a PHD. Research methodology can be difficult but this
video will make it easy.

**[#white] =**1- Nominal Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** Can be **categorized** but **__not__ ordered**
*** **Example:** Religion, Race, etc.

**[#pink] =**2- Ordinal Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** Can be **__Ordered__**, but the **differences (subtraction)** are meaningless
**** Subtraction meaningless: Saying one is better than another does not make a lot  of sense
*** **Example:** Rank, <size:15>**Size (Short, Medium, Large, X-Large),**</size> Color (spectrum, you can order colors but can't subtract them because differences are meaningless )

**[#lime] =**3- interval Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** Can be **__Ordered__** and **differences (subtraction)** are meaningful, but there is no **__"Natural Zero"__**
****:**"Natural Zero:"** A natural zero means if you get a **__zero,__**
you have absolutely none of that quantity
(whatever that quantity is) you are talking about.;
****:**Example:** --Bank balance, Age,-- etc. But not
<color #lime>**Temperature**</color> (if your thermometer reads zero temperature
does that mean **extinction of temperature?** No, it means
something on the scale). So, <color #lime>**Temperature**</color>  does not have
**"Natural Zero"**;
*** **Example:** Such as **Temperature**, **temperature is interval data**. But not --Bank balance, Age,-- etc.

**[#gold] =**4- Ratio Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** just like **interval** but with a **__"Natural Zero"__**
****:**"Natural Zero:"** A natural zero means if you get a **__zero,__**
you have absolutely none of that quantity

****:**Example:** Bank balance, Age, etc. has **"Natural Zero"** But not
<color #lime>**Temperature**</color> (if your thermometer reads zero temperature
does that mean **extinction of temperature?** No, it means

* =**Observation vs Experiment**
** Definition
*** **Observation:** Collecting data by observing natural phenomena without manipulating any variables.
*** **another Observation definition:** Measure specific traits but does not modify the subject.
*** **Experiment:** A systematic and controlled procedure performed to test a hypothesis by manipulating variables and collecting data.
*** **another Experiment definition:** Apply **treatment** and then measure the effect on the **subject.**

* =**Random**
** **Definition:** **each member** of a **population** has an equal chance of being selected in a **sample**

* =**Simple Random Sample**
** **Definition:** **each group** of a **size 'm'** has an equal chance of being selected in a **sample**

* ==**4-Common Sampling Techniques**
**[#pink] <size:16>**Convenience Sample:**</size> use the results that are easy to get (Not Random), so therefore its never used in conducting real observations or experiments
**[#lime] <size:16>**Systematic Sample:** </size> put a population in order and select every "K" member
**[#orange]  <size:16>**__Strata__fied Sample:**</size> "Strata means layers", breaks the population into subgroups based on a characteristic, then sample **__each__** group
**[#crimson] <size:16> **__Cluster__ Sample:**  </size>divide population into **"groups or clusters"** (regardless of the characteristic), randomly select a certain number "groups or clusters", & then \ncollect data from the **__entire__** cluster

* 2-Types of Sampling errors that \ncan occur while you are sampling
** __**Non Sampling Error:**__ when you write down wrong information or make a math error something like this, it's called non-sampling error.
** __**Sampling Error:**__ is the difference in characteristics between your sample and your population, because usually a sample does not **represents 100%** a population \nperfectly there will always a margin of error, and this difference (of margin error) is called sampling error
