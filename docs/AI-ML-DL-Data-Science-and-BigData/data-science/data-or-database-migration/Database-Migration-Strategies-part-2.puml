*[#yellow] Data Migration Strategies
** Full Data Dump
*** This strategy involves taking a complete copy of the data from the source database and transferring it to the target database in one operation.
** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
*** ETL involves extracting data from the source, transforming it to match the target schema, and then loading it into the new database.
** Change Data Capture (CDC)
*** CDC tracks changes made to the source database and selectively replicates these changes to the target, reducing migration time and effort.

*[#orange] Database Migration Types
** Homogeneous Migration
***[#gold] Involves migrating from one database system to another of the same type, like **Oracle to Oracle.**
** Heterogeneous Migration
***[#gold] This strategy is used when migrating data between different database systems, for example, from **MySQL to PostgreSQL.**

*[#pink] Downtime Strategies
** Offline Migration
*** The entire database is taken offline during the migration, making it inaccessible to users until the process is complete.
** Online Migration
*** Online migration allows for continuous database availability during the migration process.
** Rolling Upgrade
*** Involves migrating the database in small, incremental steps to minimize downtime.

* Data Consistency
** Consistency Checks
*** Validating data integrity before and after migration to ensure data consistency.
** Data Validation
*** Ensuring that data in the new database is accurate and corresponds to the source data.

* Rollback & Recovery
** Backup & Restore
*** Creating a backup of the target database to facilitate recovery in case of migration issues.
** Snapshot
*** Taking a snapshot of the source database for reference or rollback purposes.

* Testing Strategies
** Test Environment Setup
*** Creating a separate test environment to validate the migration process.
** Integration Testing
*** Testing the integrated system to ensure all components work together after migration.
** Performance Testing
*** Checking the new database's performance and optimizing as needed.

* Migration Tasks
** Index Rebuilding
*** Rebuilding database indexes for optimal query performance.
** Statistics Update
*** Updating query statistics to ensure efficient query execution.
** Application Validation
*** Testing applications to ensure they work correctly with the new database.

* Tools & Resources
** Migration Tools
*** Software and utilities designed to aid in the migration process.
** Documentation
*** Detailed documentation to guide migration and troubleshoot issues.
** Expert Support
*** Access to experienced professionals to assist with complex migrations.
