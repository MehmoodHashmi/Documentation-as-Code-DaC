* <i>ETL Strategy
** <i>Description
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>The **ETL strategy** involves Extracting data from the source database, Transforming it to match the target schema, and Loading it into the new database.

**[#gold] <i>Benefits
***[#orange] <i><size:14>**Data Transformation:** Allows data to be adapted and cleaned before migrating to the target database.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Data Enrichment:** Can involve enriching data with additional information during the transformation.
***[#gold] <i><size:14>**Incremental Updates:** Supports incremental data updates over time.

**[#pink] <i>Challenges
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Complexity: ** **ETL processes** can be complex and require careful design.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Development Time:**  **ETL processes** may take longer to develop than other strategies.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>**Maintenance: ** Ongoing maintenance of **ETL pipelines** is necessary.

*[#white] <i>"Phases" of **ETL Migration**
** <i>Data Extraction
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Extract data from the source database, possibly using **SQL queries** or other data export methods.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Ensure data consistency and completeness during extraction.

**[#red] <i>[[../../data-engineering/data-preprocessing-(or-wrangling)/Data-Preprocessing.puml Data Transformation]]
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Transform data to match the target schema, format, and data types.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>May involve data cleansing, validation, and business rule implementation.

** <i>Data Loading
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Load the transformed data into the target database.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Perform data validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.

** <i>Continuous Data Integration
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Implement mechanisms for ongoing data synchronization between source and target databases.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Enable real-time or scheduled updates.

** <i>Data Verification
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Verify the data in the target database to ensure it aligns with the source data.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Confirm data consistency and accuracy.

* <i>Considerations for **ETL**
**[#pink] <i>Data Mapping
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Develop detailed data mapping and transformation rules to guide the **ETL process**.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Account for differences in data structures and formats.

** <i>Data Validation
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity throughout the **ETL pipeline**.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Detect and address data inconsistencies.

** <i>Rollback Plan
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Develop a rollback plan to revert to the original database state in case of **ETL process** failures.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Safeguard against data corruption or loss.

** <i>Performance Optimization
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Optimize the performance of the **ETL processes**, including data transformation and loading.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Monitor and fine-tune **ETL jobs**.

* Best Practices
** <i>Testing and Validation
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Rigorously test **ETL processes** in a non-production environment to ensure data accuracy.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Validate application functionality with the new database.

** <i>Documentation
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Maintain detailed documentation of the **ETL processes**, including data mapping and transformation rules.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Document any issues and their resolutions.

** <i>Communication
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Communicate with stakeholders about the progress of **ETL processes** and any potential impacts.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Coordinate with application owners and users.

** <i>Monitoring and Alerting
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly address issues during **ETL processes**.
***[#yellow] <i><size:14>Detect and respond to data synchronization problems.
