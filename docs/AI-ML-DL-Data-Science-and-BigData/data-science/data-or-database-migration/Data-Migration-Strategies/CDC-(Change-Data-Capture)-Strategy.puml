* CDC Strategy
**[#lime] <i>Description
***[#gold] <i><size:12>The **CDC strategy** involves tracking and capturing changes made to the source database.
***[#gold] <i><size:12>These changes are then selectively replicated to the target database, reducing migration time and effort.

** Benefits
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Reduced Downtime: **Minimizes downtime by replicating only changes rather than the entire dataset.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Real-Time Updates:** Supports near real-time data synchronization.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Efficient Data Transfer:** Only modified data is transferred, saving bandwidth and time.

** Challenges
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Complexity:** Requires robust change tracking and replication mechanisms.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Data Integrity:** Ensuring data consistency and preventing data conflicts.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Source System Overhead:** **CDC processes** can impact the performance of the source system.

*[#gold] <i>**CDC Methods**
** Timestamp-based

** Trigger-based

** Log-based

*[#white] "Phases" of **CDC Migration**
** Change Data Capture
***[#pink] <i><size:12>Capture changes made to the source database, such as inserts, updates, and deletes.
***[#pink] <i><size:12>Employ **CDC technologies or database triggers** to identify changes.

**[#orange] Data Replication
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Replicate the captured changes to the target database.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Apply data transformations if needed to match the target schema.

** Continuous Data Synchronization
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Maintain ongoing data synchronization between the source and target databases.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Real-time or batch processing methods may be employed.

** Data Verification
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Verify the data in the target database to ensure it aligns with the source data and maintains data integrity.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Confirm data consistency and accuracy.

*[#white] <i>Considerations for **CDC**
**[#orange] Data Mapping
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Develop detailed data mapping and transformation rules to guide data replication.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Account for differences in data structures and formats.

** Conflict Resolution
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Implement mechanisms for conflict resolution in case of conflicting changes in source and target databases.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Decide how to handle data conflicts.

** Rollback Plan
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Develop a rollback plan to revert to the original database state in case of **CDC process** failures.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Safeguard against data corruption or loss.

** Performance Optimization
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Optimize the performance of **CDC processes**, including data replication and synchronization.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Monitor and fine-tune **CDC jobs**.

* Best Practices
** Testing and Validation
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Rigorously test **CDC processes** in a non-production environment to ensure data accuracy.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Validate application functionality with the new database.

** Documentation
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Maintain detailed documentation of the **CDC processes**, including data mapping, change tracking mechanisms, and transformation rules.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Document any issues and their resolutions.

** Communication
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Communicate with stakeholders about the progress of **CDC processes** and any potential impacts.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Coordinate with application owners and users.

** Monitoring and Alerting
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly address issues during **CDC processes**.
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>Detect and respond to data synchronization problems.
