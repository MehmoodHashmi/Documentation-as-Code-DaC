*[#darkblue] <i>Event Sourcing
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Definition
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Persistence of a system's state changes as a sequence of events.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Characteristics
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Immutable Events
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Recorded events are never changed or deleted.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>State Reconstruction
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>System state is derived from stored events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Time Sequencing
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Events are ordered by occurrence time.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Full Audit Trail
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Complete history of state changes is available.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Advantages
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Reconstructing State
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>System state can be rebuilt at any point in time.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Decoupling State and Behavior
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Separation of state storage from business logic.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Auditability and Compliance
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Full traceability and audit trails for compliance needs.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Supporting Multiple Views
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Events can be replayed to create different projections.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Implementation
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Event Store
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Database storing immutable events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Projections
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Derived views based on replaying events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Command Handlers
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Processes commands to generate events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Event Handlers
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>React to events to update system state.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Challenges
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Complexity
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Understanding and managing event flows.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Scalability
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Handling large event volumes efficiently.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Versioning and Evolution
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Handling changes in event structure over time.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Eventual Consistency
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Achieving consistency across multiple projections.
