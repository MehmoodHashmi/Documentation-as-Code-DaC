*[#darkblue] <i>Event Sourcing
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Definition
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Persistence of a system's state changes as a sequence of events.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Characteristics
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Immutable Events
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Recorded events are never changed or deleted.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>State Reconstruction
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>System state is derived from stored events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Time Sequencing
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Events are ordered by occurrence time.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Full Audit Trail
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Complete history of state changes is available.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Advantages
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Reconstructing State
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>System state can be rebuilt at any point in time.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Decoupling State and Behavior
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Separation of state storage from business logic.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Auditability and Compliance
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Full traceability and audit trails for compliance needs.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Supporting Multiple Views
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Events can be replayed to create different projections.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Implementation
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Event Store
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Database storing immutable events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Projections
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Derived views based on replaying events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Command Handlers
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Processes commands to generate events.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Event Handlers
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>React to events to update system state.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Challenges
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Complexity
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Understanding and managing event flows.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Scalability
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Handling large event volumes efficiently.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Versioning and Evolution
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Handling changes in event structure over time.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Eventual Consistency
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Achieving consistency across multiple projections.
