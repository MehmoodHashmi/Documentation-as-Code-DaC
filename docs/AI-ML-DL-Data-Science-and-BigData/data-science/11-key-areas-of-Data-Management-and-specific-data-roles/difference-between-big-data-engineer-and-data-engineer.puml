*: The roles of a Big Data Engineer and a Data Engineer have some overlapping responsibilities, but they also have distinct focuses and requirements.
 Here are the key differences between the two roles:

  **Big Data Engineer:**

  **Focus:** Big Data Engineers primarily work with large-scale and complex datasets, often referred to as "big data."
  They specialize in designing, implementing, and maintaining systems that handle massive volumes of data.
  **Data Infrastructure:** Big Data Engineers build and manage the infrastructure required to store, process, and analyze big data.
  This includes data storage systems, distributed computing frameworks **(e.g., Hadoop, Spark)**, and data processing pipelines.
  **Scalability and Performance:** Big Data Engineers deal with the challenges of scalability, ensuring that the infrastructure can
  handle high-volume data processing efficiently. They optimize data workflows and implement strategies to improve performance.
  **Distributed Computing:** Big Data Engineers work with distributed computing frameworks to process and analyze data in parallel
  across multiple machines or nodes.
  **Tools and Technologies:** Big Data Engineers are proficient in technologies specific to big data processing,
  such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Pig, and NoSQL databases. They have expertise in distributed file systems and data processing frameworks.

  **Data Engineer:**

  **Focus:** Data Engineers have a broader focus on managing and transforming data across various stages of the data lifecycle.
  They work with different types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
  **Data Pipeline Development:** Data Engineers design and develop data pipelines to extract, transform, and load **(ETL)** data
  from multiple sources into data storage systems. They ensure data quality and reliability throughout the pipeline.
  Data Modeling and Integration: Data Engineers work on data modeling, schema design, and data integration tasks.
  They build and optimize databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
  **Data Transformation and Manipulation:** Data Engineers are skilled in transforming and manipulating data using tools
  and technologies like SQL, scripting languages **(e.g., Python, Scala)**, and ETL frameworks.
  **Data Governance and Security:** Data Engineers address data governance and security concerns, ensuring data privacy,
  compliance, and access controls.
  **Tools and Technologies:** Data Engineers work with a wide range of data processing tools and technologies, such as
  SQL databases, ETL tools **(e.g., Informatica, Talend)**, scripting languages, and data integration frameworks.

  In summary, Big Data Engineers specialize in handling large-scale, distributed, and complex data systems, while
  Data Engineers have a broader focus on managing data across different stages of the data lifecycle. The skills
  and tools used by each role may also vary based on the specific requirements of the organization and the technologies in use.;
