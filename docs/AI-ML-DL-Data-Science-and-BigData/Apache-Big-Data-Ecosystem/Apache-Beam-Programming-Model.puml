title =__ Apache Beam Programming Model__
* Apache Beam Programming Model

** Definition
*** Unified model for building data processing pipelines that can run on various execution engines
*** Provides a high-level, expressive API for writing batch and streaming data processing jobs

** Core Concepts

*** Pipelines
**** Represents the entire data processing workflow or computation
**** Consists of one or more stages and collections of data

*** PCollections (Parallel Collections)
**** Represents a distributed collection of elements in a pipeline
**** Serves as the input and output for transformations in the pipeline

*** Transforms
**** Operations that modify or process data in a PCollection
**** Examples: Map, Filter, GroupByKey, Combine, Window

*** Windowing
**** Defines how data is divided into finite windows for time-based processing
**** Enables operations like windowed aggregations and event-time processing

** Windowing Strategies

*** Fixed Windows
**** Divides data into fixed-size, non-overlapping time windows
**** Examples: 1-minute windows, 1-hour windows

*** Sliding Windows
**** Overlaps adjacent windows by a specified duration
**** Examples: 1-hour windows with a 15-minute sliding duration

*** Session Windows
**** Groups data into windows based on gaps between events
**** Examples: User activity within 30 minutes of inactivity

** Triggers

*** Defines when to emit accumulated results for windowed computations
*** Based on event time or processing time
*** Examples: Fixed-time triggers, watermark-based triggers

** Side Inputs and Outputs

*** Side Inputs
**** Additional input data provided to a transform in a read-only manner
**** Used for enriching or filtering data during processing

*** Side Outputs
**** Additional output collections produced by a transform
**** Enables multiple outputs or branching within a pipeline

** Advanced Features

*** ParDo Function
**** Allows flexible data processing and transformations
**** Supports user-defined functions for fine-grained control

*** Stateful Processing
**** Enables maintaining and updating state across multiple elements
**** Used for aggregations, pattern detection, and complex computations

*** Timers
**** Allows setting timers for future processing based on event time or processing time
**** Enables time-based operations and event-time processing
