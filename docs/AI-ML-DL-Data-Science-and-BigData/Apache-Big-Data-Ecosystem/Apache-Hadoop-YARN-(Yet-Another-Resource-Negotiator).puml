* Apache Hadoop YARN
** Overview
*** Resource Management Framework
*** Separates Cluster Resource Management from Data Processing
*** Part of the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem

** Components
*** ResourceManager
**** Manages Cluster Resources
**** Schedules Applications
**** Monitors NodeManagers
*** NodeManager
**** Manages Resources on Individual Nodes
**** Reports Resource Utilization to ResourceManager
*** ApplicationMaster
**** Manages Application Lifecycle
**** Negotiates Resources with ResourceManager
**** Coordinates Task Execution

** Features
*** Scalability
**** Scales Horizontally Across Cluster Nodes
**** Handles Large-Scale Data Processing
*** Flexibility
**** Supports Various Application Frameworks (e.g., MapReduce, Spark)
**** Allows Custom Application Scheduling Policies
*** Multi-Tenancy
**** Supports Simultaneous Execution of Multiple Applications
**** Resource Isolation Between Applications
*** Fault Tolerance
**** Automatic Task Recovery
**** Node Failure Handling
*** Resource Allocation
**** Dynamic Resource Allocation
**** Fine-Grained Resource Management

** Workflow
*** Application Submission
**** Submit Application to ResourceManager
**** ResourceManager Allocates ApplicationMaster
*** Resource Negotiation
**** ApplicationMaster Requests Resources from ResourceManager
**** ResourceManager Allocates Container Resources
*** Task Execution
**** ApplicationMaster Launches Tasks in Containers
**** Task Execution on NodeManagers
*** Monitoring and Status Updates
**** ApplicationMaster Reports Task Status to ResourceManager
**** ResourceManager Updates Application Status

** Use Cases
*** Batch Processing
*** Stream Processing
*** Interactive Queries
*** Machine Learning
*** Real-Time Analytics

** Integration with Apache Hadoop Ecosystem
*** Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
*** Apache MapReduce
*** Apache Hive
*** Apache Spark

** Benefits
*** Efficient Resource Utilization
*** Improved Cluster Utilization
*** Enhanced Application Performance
*** Multi-Tenancy Support
