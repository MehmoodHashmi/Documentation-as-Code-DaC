* Apache Kafka Log Data Structure
** Introduction
*** Distributed streaming platform
*** Handles high-throughput, fault-tolerant messaging
*** Based on a publish-subscribe model
** Log Abstraction
*** Topics
**** Logical category or feed name
**** Data is organized into topics
*** Partitions
**** Each topic is divided into multiple partitions
**** Independent and ordered sequence of records
*** Records
**** Unit of data in Kafka
**** Key-value pair with optional metadata
** Log Storage
*** Segments
**** Each partition is divided into segments
**** Fixed-size files containing sequential records
*** Index Files
**** Maps offset ranges to physical file positions
**** Enables fast record lookup and retrieval
*** Compaction
**** Removes redundant or obsolete records
**** Maintains a more compact log storage
** Log Replication
*** Replicas
**** Multiple copies of a partition across brokers
**** Provides fault tolerance and high availability
*** Leader and Follower
**** Leader handles read and write operations
**** Followers replicate data from the leader
*** In-Sync Replicas (ISR)
**** Subset of replicas that are synchronized with the leader
**** Ensures data consistency and reliability
** Log Commit and Retention
***[#pink] Offset
**** Sequential identifier for each record in a partition
**** Represents the position in the log
*** Consumer Offset
**** Maintains the progress of a consumer group
**** Tracks the offset of consumed records
*** Log Compaction
**** Retains the latest record for each key
**** Deletes older records with the same key
*** Log Retention Policy
**** Determines how long data is retained in Kafka
**** Based on time or log size
** Kafka Connect and Streaming APIs
*** Kafka Connect
**** Tool for importing and exporting data
**** Enables integration with external systems
*** Streaming APIs
**** Provides stream processing capabilities
**** Allows real-time data processing and transformations
** Use Cases
*** Real-time Data Streaming
*** Event Sourcing
*** Log Aggregation and Analysis
*** Messaging and Queuing
** Benefits
*** High Throughput and Scalability
*** Fault Tolerance and Replication
*** Durability and Persistence
*** Real-time Stream Processing
*** Ecosystem and Integration
** Apache Kafka Ecosystem
*** Kafka Streams
**** Stream processing library
**** Enables building real-time applications
*** Kafka Connectors
**** Pre-built integrations with external systems
**** Simplifies data ingestion and export
*** Schema Registry
**** Centralized schema management
**** Ensures data compatibility and consistency
*** Kafka Security
**** Authentication and Authorization mechanisms
**** Encryption and SSL/TLS support
