*[#darkblue] <i>Hidden Layers
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Overview
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Intermediate layers in a neural network that perform feature extraction and data transformation.
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Consist of multiple neurons or nodes connected to adjacent layers.
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Role
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Feature Extraction
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Process and extract relevant features from the input data.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Hierarchical representations are learned in deep networks.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Data Transformation
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Non-linear transformations applied to the input data.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Multiple hidden layers enable the network to capture complex patterns.
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Layer Types
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Fully Connected Layers
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>All neurons are connected to every neuron in adjacent layers.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Common in feedforward neural networks.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Convolutional Layers
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Specialized for grid-like data (e.g., images).
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Use convolution and pooling operations for feature extraction.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Recurrent Layers
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series, text).
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Capture temporal dependencies in data.
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Activation Functions
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Apply non-linear transformations to layer outputs.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Ensure that gradients can flow through the network.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Depth and Width
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Depth
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Refers to the number of hidden layers in the network.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Deep networks can capture complex representations.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Width
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Refers to the number of neurons in a hidden layer.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Wider layers can model more intricate patterns.
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Challenges
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Overfitting
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Complex models may capture noise in data.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay are needed.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Vanishing and Exploding Gradients
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Issues in deep networks when gradients vanish or explode.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Addressed by specialized layers and activations (e.g., LSTM, GRU).
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Best Practices
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Layer Selection
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Choose layer types based on the nature of the data and task.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Adjust layer depth and width to optimize model performance.
***[#green] <b><color #white><i><size:14>Regularization
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Apply techniques to prevent overfitting.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>Include dropout, weight decay, or batch normalization.
