*[#darkblue] <i>Loss Function
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><b><size:14>Overview
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:16>A **loss function**, also known as a "cost function or objective function", quantifies the "error or discrepancy" between **predicted and actual values** in machine learning models.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><b><size:14>Types of Loss Functions
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>Mean Squared Error (MSE)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Measures the average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Measures the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>Cross-Entropy Loss
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Commonly used in classification problems to measure the dissimilarity between predicted and true class distributions.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>Hinge Loss
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Used in **support vector machines (SVM)** and is especially suited for classification tasks.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>Huber Loss
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>A hybrid loss function that combines the characteristics of MSE and MAE.
