*[#darkblue] <i>Biases and Bias Neurons
**[#lightblue] <i><size:18>Biases
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Purpose
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Biases are parameters associated with individual neurons in a neural network.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>They help shift the activation function of neurons, allowing them to activate at different input levels.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Learnable
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Biases are learnable during the training process and contribute to the adaptability of the network.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:18>Bias Neurons
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Purpose
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons are specialized neurons used to provide a constant input to other neurons in the network.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>They allow the network to learn an offset or bias for the entire layer they connect to.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Fixed Output
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons typically have a fixed output, often set to 1, and no incoming connections.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Activation Shift
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>They help shift the activation function of neurons in the layer they connect to.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:12>Usage
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Biases
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Biases are associated with individual neurons and adjust their response to different inputs.
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Bias Neurons
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons affect the entire layer, providing a consistent shift in activation for all neurons.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:12>Training
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Biases
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>During training, biases are adjusted by optimization algorithms to minimize prediction errors.

****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Connection weights to bias neurons are learned to fine-tune the behavior of the layer.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:12>Implementation
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:12> Biases
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Each neuron has its associated bias value in the network.

*[#darkblue] <i><size:12>Bias Neuron
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>Purpose
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>A "bias neuron" is a specialized neuron used in neural networks to provide a constant input to other neurons, allowing the network to learn an offset or bias.

**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>Characteristics
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Fixed Output
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>The output of a bias neuron is typically set to a constant value, often 1, and it has no incoming connections.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Learnable Offset
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>While the bias neuron's output is constant, the network can adjust its connection weights to effectively learn an offset for the entire layer it connects to.

**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>Usage
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Activation Shift
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons help shift the activation function of the neurons in a layer. They allow neurons to activate not only based on the weighted sum of inputs but also with an added offset.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Enhancing Flexibility
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons enhance the flexibility and expressive power of neural networks by allowing them to model more complex functions.

**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>Training
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Weight Adjustment
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>During training, the network adjusts the connection weights between the bias neuron and other neurons in the layer to minimize prediction errors.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Role in Learning
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons play a role in fine-tuning and adjusting the overall behavior of a neural network during the training process.

**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>Implementation
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Added as a Neuron
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>A bias neuron is added as a regular neuron with a fixed output value (e.g., 1) and no incoming connections.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Connected to a Layer
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons are typically connected to an entire layer, and their output affects all neurons in that layer.

**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>Significance
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:12>Model Flexibility
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:12>Bias neurons contribute to the adaptability and generalization abilities of neural networks.
