*[#darkblue] <i> Model Evaluation
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Definition
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:22>Model evaluation is the process of assessing the **"performance and effectiveness"** of machine learning and statistical models.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Purpose
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:22>To determine how well a "model" generalizes to "unseen data" and "makes predictions".

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Evaluation Metrics
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14><b>Classification Metrics
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>For <b>binary and multiclass classification models:
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC, <b>Confusion Matrix.

***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14><b>Regression Metrics
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:14>For <b>regression models:
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Mean Absolute Error **(MAE)**, Mean Squared Error **(MSE)**, Root Mean Squared Error **(RMSE)**, R-squared **(R2)**.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Cross-Validation
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Technique for estimating a model's performance by partitioning data into training and testing sets multiple times.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Overfitting and Underfitting
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Understanding and diagnosing model behavior with respect to training data.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Bias-Variance Trade-Off
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Balancing model complexity and generalization.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Hyperparameter Tuning
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Optimization of model parameters to improve performance.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Validation and Test Sets
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Proper data splitting to avoid data leakage and over-optimistic evaluation.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Real-World Applications
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Evaluating models for predicting customer churn, image recognition, disease diagnosis, and financial forecasting.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Considerations
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Choice of evaluation metrics and techniques depends on the type of problem and specific goals.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Model Comparison
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Comparing multiple models to select the most suitable one for a given task.

**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Challenges
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:14>Dealing with imbalanced datasets, handling missing data, and choosing appropriate evaluation techniques.
