* Genetic Engineering
** Definition
*** The direct manipulation of an organism's genes to achieve desired traits or outcomes.

** Techniques
*** Recombinant DNA Technology
**** Splicing genes from one organism into another.
**** Creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
*** CRISPR-Cas9
**** Precise gene editing by cutting and modifying DNA sequences.
*** Gene Cloning
**** Creating identical copies of genes or organisms.
*** Tissue Culture
**** Growing cells or tissues in a controlled environment.
*** Gene Sequencing
**** Determining the order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule.

** Applications
*** Medicine
**** Gene Therapy to treat genetic disorders.
**** Production of insulin and other biopharmaceuticals.
*** Agriculture
**** Developing pest-resistant and drought-tolerant crops.
**** Improving crop yields and nutritional content.
*** Industry
**** Manufacturing enzymes, biofuels, and biodegradable plastics.
**** Environmental bioremediation.
*** Research
**** Creating disease models and studying gene function.
**** Genetic modification of model organisms for scientific studies.

** Ethical and Regulatory Considerations
*** GMO Regulations
**** Oversight of genetically modified organisms.
**** Labeling and consumer awareness.
*** Ethical Dilemmas
**** Balancing potential benefits with environmental and safety concerns.
**** Ethical use of gene editing technologies.

** Innovations and Trends
*** Precision Medicine
**** Tailoring medical treatments to an individual's genetic makeup.
*** Synthetic Biology
**** Designing and creating new biological components and systems.
*** Designer Babies
**** Controversial concept of selecting specific traits in human embryos.
*** Gene Drives

*** CRISPR Applications
**** Expanding uses of CRISPR in research and biotechnology.

** Challenges and Concerns
*** Off-Target Effects
**** Unintended consequences of gene editing.
*** Ethical and Social Controversies
**** Debates over the ethics of altering genetics.
*** Environmental Impact
**** Potential effects of GMOs on ecosystems.
*** Accessibility and Equity
**** Ensuring fair access to genetic technologies.

** Impact on Society
*** Medical Advancements
**** Potential cures for genetic diseases.
*** Enhanced Crop Production
**** More efficient and resilient agriculture.
