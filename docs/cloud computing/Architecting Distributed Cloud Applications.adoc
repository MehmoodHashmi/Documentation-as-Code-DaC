:toc-title: Technology Agnostic Cloud Computing
:doctype: book

I work as a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, and I help our customers build applications using the Azure Cloud.
So I'm going to guess that a Cloud Solution Architect does a lot of architecture.
Yes, you are right, Actually this is a word which is always confusing because it means different things to different people,
absolutely yeah, it can be basic for some people, or it can be a larger enterprise in nature.
So, when you do architecture, what do you mean by architecture?
Okay for me, it is helping customers understand what are the pieces they have today & they can bring in new technologies that we are offering in the cloud, how to make those things work interchangeably, so when people have an application that may exist today, they may say we want to Azure, but we do not know how to make those pieces fit with technologies that Microsoft had offered.
So we use visual tools like whiteboard,
discussion or presentation to help customers understand what is an actual road map.
Some people have existing applications that they want to migrate & some people are doing green field kind of deployment.
they ask how we best align the way
people are building applications today instead of doing it the way they were doing it 10-years ago
& then again updating it.

*Server-less* is an even advanced concept:

NOTE: *Container image:../DevOps/images/docker.svg[width=40]* #---># *_Kubernetes_* #---># *_server-less_* #---># *(Future ?)*

*_##Server-less [.underline]#program# does auto-scaling (vertically & horizontally)##_*

*Serverless computing* is a *cloud computing model* which enables *developers* to build and run applications without the need to manage or provision servers. Some key attributes of serverless computing are *#scalability, cost efficiency, flexibility, and simplified development and deployment.#* It offers a pay-as-you-go model, allowing developers to only pay for the resources they use, and it also offers *near-instant scalability, allowing applications to scale up and down automatically as needed*. Additionally, serverless computing eliminates the need to manage server infrastructure, as all the servers are managed by the cloud provider, and makes development and deployment simpler and faster.

Cloud applications are fundamentally different than traditional applications that run on the desktop, in a browser, or on a mobile device. This master class from Wintellect cofounder and Microsoft Software Architect Jeffrey Richter offers a deep dive into cloud architecture that is independent of platform. Whether you are designing applications for Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or other cloud platforms, watching this series — and absorbing the principles contained therein — is a MUST before writing the first line of code.

Learn how to architect distributed cloud apps with the right developer mindset, the finest cloud technologies, and the best cloud patterns.



[.underline]#_This +++ <mark> <b> technology-agnostic </b></mark> +++ video course begins by explaining the benefits of distributed cloud applications with an emphasis on maintaining high-availability and scalability in a cost-effective way while also dealing with inevitable hardware and software failures._#

Then, the course moves on to:

• Microservices and containers

• Networking communication

• Messaging communication

• Versioning, upgrading and configuration

• Data storage services

• Disaster recovery



This course is for anyone considering or actively working on a distributed cloud application. It is designed to provide you with a thorough understanding of these concepts, the various pros and cons of specific technologies, and the resilient patterns that are heavily used by distributed cloud applications. This knowledge will help you to easily build cost-efficient and fault-tolerant systems.

== Fundamentals

=== Description

In Part 1 of this landmark series, Wintellect cofounder and Microsoft Software Architect Jeffrey Richter presents the basic principles of cloud architecture. Learn about services, microservices, failure and fault tolerance, auto-scaling, containers, 12-factor applications, and more, and build an understanding of how distributed cloud applications work and the building blocks that make them up.

<1> What is *orchestration vs automation*?

* *Automation* refers to automating a single process or a small number of related tasks, (e.g., deploying an app).
* *Orchestration* refers to managing multiple automated tasks to create a dynamic workflow (e.g., deploying an app, connecting it to a network, and integrating it with other systems).
<2> The purpose of an *Orchestrator*:

Infrastructure/PIatform/Containers/Functions as a Service
(aka Orchestrators)

• Manage a cluster's (set of PC/VMs) lifecycle, networking,
health, upgrades, scaling, & deploys/runs service code.

== Networking Communication

=== Description
Microservices use networking to communicate with each other, but architecting a robust microservice-based application is not as simple as replacing function calls with network calls. In this session, Jeffrey introduces important concepts such as API versioning, client retries, and idempotence, and explains why they are critical to distributed cloud architectures.

== Messaging
=== Description
*_Queues_* are used to facilitate reliable message-based communication between services. Learn what queues are, why messaging communication with queues is frequently preferable to networking communication, and what implications queues have for the design and implementation of distributed cloud applications.

=== Description

Leader election is a pattern that is commonly used in distributed cloud applications.
