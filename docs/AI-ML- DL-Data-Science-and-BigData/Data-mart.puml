* Data Mart
** Overview
*** **A Data Mart is a specialized subset of a data warehouse that focuses on a specific subject area or department within an organization.**
***[#pink] It provides a consolidated view of data specifically tailored to the needs of a particular business unit or user group.
** Purpose
*** Supports decision-making and analysis within a specific functional area or department.
*** Provides a simplified and optimized structure for querying and reporting on relevant data.
** Characteristics
*** **Subject-Oriented**
****[#pink] Organized around a **specific subject area,** such as **sales, finance, or marketing.**
***[#pink] **Optimized Schema**
**** Utilizes a **dimensional model,** typically based on **star or snowflake schema,** for efficient data retrieval.
***[#pink] **Subset of Data Warehouse**
****[#yellow] Contains a subset of the data from the overall data warehouse, focusing on the most relevant data for a particular business unit.
*** Aggregated and Summarized Data
**** Often includes pre-calculated aggregations and summary measures for faster query performance.
** Benefits
*** Improved Performance
**** Data Marts are designed to provide fast and efficient query performance for specific business needs.
*** Business User-Friendly
**** Data Marts are designed with a user-friendly structure, making it easier for business users to navigate and access the data they need.
*** Increased Agility
**** Data Marts enable faster development and deployment cycles compared to a large, centralized data warehouse.
*** Enhanced Data Quality
**** Data Marts allow for data validation and cleansing specific to the subject area, ensuring high-quality data.
** Types of Data Marts
*** Dependent Data Mart
**** Derived directly from the central data warehouse and shares the same data structures.
*** Independent Data Mart
**** Built separately from the central data warehouse and has its own data structures and ETL processes.
*** Virtual Data Mart
**** Provides a logical view of the data without physically moving or duplicating it.
** **Data Mart Design Considerations**
*** **Business Requirements**
****[#pink] Understand the specific business requirements and reporting needs of the targeted user group.
*** Data Granularity
**** Determine the appropriate level of detail and granularity of the data to be included in the Data Mart.
*** Data Integration
**** Identify the necessary data sources and design an integration strategy for populating the Data Mart.
*** Data Governance and Security
**** Define data governance and security policies to ensure data integrity and protect sensitive information.
*** Data Mart Structure
**** Choose an appropriate dimensional modeling technique, such as star or snowflake schema, to structure the Data Mart.
*** ETL Processes
**** Design and implement Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to populate and maintain the Data Mart.
