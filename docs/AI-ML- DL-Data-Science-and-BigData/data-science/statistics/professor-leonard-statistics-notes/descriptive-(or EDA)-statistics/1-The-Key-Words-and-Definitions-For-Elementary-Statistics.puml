*[#red] =Lecture-1 Part-1: **The-Key-Words-and-Definitions-For-Elementary-Statistics**
* =**Data**
** =When we are talking about the __**data**__ in this class (statistics lectures) that means <color #green>**observations**</color>
** **Definition:** Any <size:22><color #green>**observations**</color> </size> that have been __collected__

* =**Statistics**
** =Collect data
***[#pink] You have to collect the data appropriately, so that your data is not **biased data**
***:*If you Collect data and do not know what to do with it, then it's **wasted time and useless data.**
*Why? because you don't know **how to  analyze, interpret and draw conclusions from data.**
*__Then collected data does not matter at all and data itself does not matter.__;

** =Analyze data
** =Interpret data
**[#red] =And draw conclusions from data

* =**Population**
** Complete set of all elements to be studied (OR being studied)
** **Is it necessary to study __each element__ of the <size:22>"set"? No**

*[#pink] =**Parameter and statistic**
** **Parameter:** Characteristic (trait) of a **Population**
** **Statistic:** Characteristic (trait) of a **Sample**
**:**Example:** These two **(parameter and statistic) could be talking about the same thing.** It just depends on what **group (population or sample)** you are referring.
E.g. if you find out that everybody's hair color in America is blond then it's **parameter**, everybody's hair color is blond. This will be characteristic of entire population.
__But if you take a **sample** from the **population** and then talk those **characteristics** then we refer them as **statistics**__;

* =**Sample**
** is generally smaller than **population** OR **sample** is some subset of the **population**
**[#pink] **Statistics** generally deals with the **samples**
***[#pink] **Population** is usually too big or huge for you to get any information in a timely manner
***[#pink] Your **sample** must be **random** so that it is not **biased data**. In other words, when you collect data make sure that you collect it randomly

* **Consensus**
** is collecting from **every member** of a **population**
**[#pink] **Statistics** generally deals with the **samples**
***[#pink] **Population** is usually too big or huge for you to get any information in a timely manner

*[#pink] =**Types of data**
**[#gold] ==**1. Qualitative Data (is <color #crimson>__categorical__</color>)** \n<img:images/img_38.png> \nUse your <size:22>**senses** (internal & external)</size> \nto observe results
*** **Definition:** Data that is **Non-Numeric**

***[#pink] =Imbalance Data
****[#pink] **The term __Imbalance Data__ is used when you are working** \n**with __categorical data__ or (non-numeric data)**
*****[#yellow] ===Accuracy
******[#yellow] ===If model has given you near to \n100% accuracy on training data then \nit is called **over-fit** & this is bad
*****[#yellow] ===Precision
*****[#yellow] ===Recall
*** **Examples:** Gender, Color, Race, Religion, Ethnicity, Army Rank, Zip Code (some **data** like **zip code** might have numbers in them but still they are **Quantitative**)
*** **Math operations** are **meaningless on Qualitative data** (or categorical data), \nyou can't add, subtract, multiply, divide qualitative data
****[#red] =**Examples**
***** **Nominal data**

**[#gold] ==**2. Quantitative Data** \n<img:images/img_39.png>
*** =**Definition:** its //**__numerical__**// data
**** <img:images/img_32.png>
***** <img:images/img_51.png>

*****:=__Number Theory:__
* <size:22>**Real Numbers**
** <size:16>**__Rational numbers__**
*** Integers **{...,-3, -2, -1, <color:crimson>0,</color> 1, 2, 3,...}**
**** Whole numbers e.g. {**<color:crimson>0,</color>** 1, 2, 3,...}
***** Natural numbers e.g. {1, 2, 3, ...}
** <size:16>**__Irrational numbers__**;
****** <img:images/img_50.png>
******* <img:images/img_52.png>
********:These different types of numbers fall under the broader category of mathematics and specifically number theory and mathematical analysis. Here's how these number types are categorized:

         1. **Natural Numbers (N)**: These are the positive whole numbers starting from 1 (1, 2, 3, ...). They are a fundamental concept in elementary mathematics.

         2. **Integers (Z)**: Integers include all positive whole numbers (natural numbers), all negative whole numbers, and zero (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
         Integers are used in various mathematical contexts, including algebra and number theory.

         3. **Rational Numbers (Q)**: Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers where the denominator is not zero. They include integers and fractions
         (e.g., -3, 1/2, 3.75). Rational numbers are a fundamental concept in elementary mathematics.

         4. **Irrational Numbers**: Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as fractions of two integers. Examples include the square root of 2 (√2), pi (π), and the mathematical constant e.
          They are studied in both number theory and mathematical analysis.

         5. **Real Numbers (R)**: Real numbers include both rational and irrational numbers. They represent all possible points on the number line. Real numbers are a central concept in **real**
         **analysis, calculus,** and other branches of mathematics.

         6. **Complex Numbers (C)**: Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part (a + bi), where "a" and "b" are real numbers, and "i" is the imaginary unit (√(-1)). Complex
          numbers are studied in complex analysis and are used extensively in various mathematical and scientific fields, including engineering and physics.

         So, while these numbers are fundamental to mathematics as a whole, they have their own subtopics and areas of study within mathematics, ranging from elementary arithmetic (natural
         numbers) to advanced topics like complex analysis (complex numbers).;

***[#pink] =Skewness
****[#pink] **The term __Skewness__ is used when** \n**you are working with __numeric data__**
*****[#yellow] **Left skewed**
*****[#yellow] **Right skewed**
*****[#yellow] **Normally distributed**
*****[#yellow] **IQR**
*** **Examples:** Height, weight, wages, MPH (miles per hour), Temperature, Time
*** **Math operations** are **meaningful on Quantitative data**, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide **quantitative data**
****[#red] =**Examples**
***** **Interval data**
***** **Ratio data**
***[#lime] ==**2-Types of Quantitative Data**
****[#yellow] ==1. Discrete Data
***** **Definition:** **Countable OR finite** (meaning there are only certain number of elements/values you can pick from)
***** **Example:** does a chicken lays half eggs, would you like to buy half washing machines, rolling a dice, etc.
***** Usually a <size:18>**count**
*****[#orange] **Color Palettes**
******[#white] **Categorical**
*******[#yellow] ===**Qualitative or categorical palettes are the best suitable to plot the categorical data as follows:**\n<img:images/img_55.png>
*******[#pink] ===When to use:
********[#yellow] Discrete or qualitative data with no natural ordering


****[#yellow] ==2. Continuous Data
***** **Definition:** **Infinite number of values or elements** (not countable)
***** **Example:** Temperature, Length, etc.
***** Usually a <size:16>**__Measurement__**\n<img:images/img_33.png>
****** Measurements are not easy, depends on tool the used and how specific you want to be
****** **Measurements** are made with instruments such as rulers, balances, graduated cylinders,\n breakers, and thermometers, these results are **measurable. numbers**
*****[#orange] ===**Color Palettes**
******[#gold] ===**Continous or** \n===**Sequential**
*******[#yellow] **Sequential plots are suitable to express the distribution of data** \n**ranging from relative lower values to higher values within a range.** \n<img:images/img_56.png>
*******[#pink] ===When to use:
********[#yellow] Continuous data with a natural ordering, with a clear progression

******[#gold] ===**Diverging**
*******[#yellow] **Diverging palettes use two different colors. Each color represents variation in the value ranging from a common point in either direction.** \n* **We assume plotting the data ranging from -1 to 1. The values from -1 to 0 takes one color and 0 to +1 takes another color.** \n<img:images/img_57.png> \nDiverging color palettes are good for continuous data with a meaningful middle point. This is because diverging palettes are designed to show deviations from a central value, which is typically \nrepresented by a neutral color in the middle of the palette. The two ends of the palette are then used to represent values that are above or below the central value, with darker colors typically \nrepresenting larger deviations.


*******[#pink] ===When to use:
********[#yellow] Continuous data with a meaningful middle point

is all about describing your data. To do this we firstly describe the spread of the data using the range and interquartile range.
Then we might look at the central tendency of the data using the mean, median and mode. We might also describe the variability using
the standard deviation and variance.
= And of course we want to visualise the data using graphs and plots. Selecting the right plot and graph might seem difficult
= but it is really quite easy when you think about the __two most important types of variables.__

= <color #crimson>**Categorical**</color> and <color #lime>**numeric**</color> variables.
* <size:18>A **__single categorical variable__** is usually represented with a **bar chart or bar plot.**
* <size:18>A **__single numerical variable__** is visualized with a **histogram or box plot (or boxplot).**
* <size:18>For **__two numerics__** we use a **scatter plot** and and so on.

This video will talk you through all of the combinations of variables, and how to create graphics that really talk to your audience.
If you're interested in data science and quantitative analysis, then this video is for you. If you are a beginner and want to learn
about statistics and how to work with data, then you'll love this video. This video is good for those learning data science but also
anyone wanting to learn about research methods for a masters degree of a PHD. Research methodology can be difficult but this

* =Categories of \n=Data & Learning
**:Unlabeled data typically falls under the category of "Unsupervised Learning" in the context of machine learning.
Unsupervised learning is a type of learning where the data does not have predefined labels or categories. The goal
is to explore the patterns, relationships, or structures within the data without any specific guidance.;
** Labeled Data

***** __Problem conversion__ from __regression__ \nto __classification__ or vice versa
****** What should be the thought process?
*******:* What is the problem that I'm trying to solve? Identification of problem
* Which thing am I trying to determine?
** Do I've the necessary data for the thing I'm trying to determine?
*** If yes, then go ahead and solve the problem.
*** Otherwise, determine the reason for why don't you 've the necessary data
**** Based on the reason you 've identified you will change your data-set **OR**
        you will change your problem from __regression to classification__ or from
        classification to regression as per demand.;
****** =Example
*******:Let say you 've to predict the temperature. And predicting the temperature I think
is regression problem, because the temperature is interval data and it can be 20, 30, or
50 celsius. But I think my regression model will not work nicely on this model, So I will
divide the temperature data into 3-classes (low, medium & high) temperature.
* low temperature = 1-15 celsius
* medium temperature = 16-30 celsius
* high temperature = 36-50 celsius

Notice carefully earlier my problem was a regression problem and now it had become a
classification problem. So for my convenience I had molded the data in a different
manner and resultantly made it a classification problem.;

** Unlabeled Data
***[#pink] **Unsupervised Learning**
****[#yellow] ===Clustering
****[#yellow] ===Dimensionality Reduction
****[#yellow] ===Anomaly Detection
**:This updated mindmap script reflects the distinction between labeled data used in supervised learning tasks and unlabeled data used
in unsupervised learning tasks. Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover patterns, groupings, or anomalies in the data without
relying on predefined labels.;

*:The distinction between labeled and unlabeled data is primarily used in the field of machine learning, where it plays a crucial role
in the training and development of models. However, the concept of labeled and unlabeled data can also be relevant in other disciplines
that involve data analysis and pattern recognition. Here are a few examples:

* **Data Mining:** Data mining is a field that focuses on discovering patterns, relationships, and insights from large datasets.
In data mining, labeled data is often used for supervised learning tasks, while unlabeled data can be utilized for
unsupervised learning tasks such as clustering or anomaly detection.

* **Statistics:** In statistics, labeled data is commonly used for statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
**__Unlabeled data__,** on the other hand, can be explored using techniques like **exploratory data analysis or clustering** to gain insights
into the underlying structure of the data.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** In NLP, labeled data is often required for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition,
or text classification. Unlabeled data can be utilized for tasks such as topic modeling or word embeddings, where the goal is to uncover
latent patterns or representations in text.

While the terminology may vary across disciplines, the fundamental idea of distinguishing between labeled and unlabeled data remains
applicable in various fields that involve data analysis, modeling, and pattern recognition.;

*[#red] Lecture-1 Part-3: **Sampling Techniques: How to Develop a __random Sample__**

* =**Observation vs Experiment**
** Definition
*** **Observation:** Collecting data by observing natural phenomena without manipulating any variables.
*** **another Observation definition:** Measure specific traits but does not modify the subject.
*** **Experiment:** A systematic and controlled procedure performed to test a hypothesis by manipulating variables and collecting data.
*** **another Experiment definition:** Apply **treatment** and then measure the effect on the **subject.**

* =**Random**
** **Definition:** **each member** of a **population** has an equal chance of being selected in a **sample**

* =**Simple Random Sample**
** **Definition:** **each group** of a **size 'm'** has an equal chance of being selected in a **sample**

* ==**4-Common Sampling Techniques**
**[#pink] <size:16>**Convenience Sample:**</size> use the results that are easy to get (Not Random), so therefore its never used in conducting real observations or experiments
**[#lime] <size:16>**Systematic Sample:** </size> put a population in order and select every "K" member
**[#orange]  <size:16>**__Strata__fied Sample:**</size> "Strata means layers", breaks the population into subgroups based on a characteristic, then sample **__each__** group
**[#crimson] <size:16> **__Cluster__ Sample:**  </size>divide population into **"groups or clusters"** (regardless of the characteristic), randomly select a certain number "groups or clusters", & then \ncollect data from the **__entire__** cluster

* 2-Types of Sampling errors that \ncan occur while you are sampling
** __**Non Sampling Error:**__ when you write down wrong information or make a math error something like this, it's called non-sampling error.
** __**Sampling Error:**__ is the difference in characteristics between your sample and your population, because usually a sample does not **represents 100%** a population \nperfectly there will always a margin of error, and this difference (of margin error) is called sampling error
