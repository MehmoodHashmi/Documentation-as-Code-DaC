* Offline Migration Strategy
** Description
*** An offline migration strategy involves taking the entire database offline during migration.
*** Users cannot access the database until the migration is complete.

** Benefits
*** **Simplicity: **Easier to implement as the database is entirely offline.
*** **Data consistency:** No concurrent updates during migration.

**[#gold] Challenges
*** **Downtime: **Significant downtime is required, impacting users and business operations.
*** **Data transfer:** Transferring a large amount of data can be time-consuming.

* Phases of Offline Migration
** Pre-Migration Preparation
*** **Backup:** Create a complete backup of the source database to ensure data recovery.
*** **Plan:** Develop a detailed migration plan, including rollback procedures.

**[#yellow] Downtime
*** **Database Shutdown:** Take the source database offline, preventing any user access.
*** **Data Export:** Extract data from the source database in preparation for transfer.

** Data Transfer
*** **Data Loading:** Load the extracted data into the target database.
*** **Schema Changes:** Apply any necessary schema transformations during the migration.

** Post-Migration Validation
*** **Data Consistency: **Verify data consistency between source and target databases.
*** **Application Testing:** Ensure that applications work correctly with the new database.

** Database Start-Up
*** Bring the target database online for users to access.

* Best Practices
** Communication
*** Inform stakeholders about the planned downtime and its duration.
*** Set clear expectations for the impact on business operations.

** Rollback Plan
*** Develop a well-documented rollback plan in case issues arise during migration.

** Performance Optimization
*** Optimize database performance post-migration, such as rebuilding indexes and updating statistics.

** Testing
*** Thoroughly test the migration process in a non-production environment before executing it in production.

** Monitoring
*** Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly address any issues during migration.
