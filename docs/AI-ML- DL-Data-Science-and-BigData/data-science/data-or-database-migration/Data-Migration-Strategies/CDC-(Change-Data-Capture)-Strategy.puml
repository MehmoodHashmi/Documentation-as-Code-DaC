* CDC Strategy
** Description
*** The CDC strategy involves tracking and capturing changes made to the source database.
*** These changes are then selectively replicated to the target database, reducing migration time and effort.

** Benefits
*** **Reduced Downtime: **Minimizes downtime by replicating only changes rather than the entire dataset.
*** **Real-Time Updates:** Supports near real-time data synchronization.
*** **Efficient Data Transfer:** Only modified data is transferred, saving bandwidth and time.

** Challenges
*** **Complexity:** Requires robust change tracking and replication mechanisms.
*** **Data Integrity:** Ensuring data consistency and preventing data conflicts.
*** **Source System Overhead:** CDC processes can impact the performance of the source system.

* Phases of CDC Migration
** Change Data Capture
***[#pink] Capture changes made to the source database, such as inserts, updates, and deletes.
***[#gold] Employ CDC technologies or database triggers to identify changes.

**[#orange] Data Replication
*** Replicate the captured changes to the target database.
*** Apply data transformations if needed to match the target schema.

** Continuous Data Synchronization
*** Maintain ongoing data synchronization between the source and target databases.
*** Real-time or batch processing methods may be employed.

** Data Verification
*** Verify the data in the target database to ensure it aligns with the source data and maintains data integrity.
*** Confirm data consistency and accuracy.

* Considerations for CDC
**[#orange] Data Mapping
*** Develop detailed data mapping and transformation rules to guide data replication.
*** Account for differences in data structures and formats.

** Conflict Resolution
*** Implement mechanisms for conflict resolution in case of conflicting changes in source and target databases.
*** Decide how to handle data conflicts.

** Rollback Plan
*** Develop a rollback plan to revert to the original database state in case of CDC process failures.
*** Safeguard against data corruption or loss.

** Performance Optimization
*** Optimize the performance of CDC processes, including data replication and synchronization.
*** Monitor and fine-tune CDC jobs.

* Best Practices
** Testing and Validation
*** Rigorously test CDC processes in a non-production environment to ensure data accuracy.
*** Validate application functionality with the new database.

** Documentation
*** Maintain detailed documentation of the CDC processes, including data mapping, change tracking mechanisms, and transformation rules.
*** Document any issues and their resolutions.

** Communication
*** Communicate with stakeholders about the progress of CDC processes and any potential impacts.
*** Coordinate with application owners and users.

** Monitoring and Alerting
*** Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly address issues during CDC processes.
*** Detect and respond to data synchronization problems.
