* ETL Strategy
** Description
*** The ETL strategy involves Extracting data from the source database, Transforming it to match the target schema, and Loading it into the new database.

**[#gold] Benefits
***[#yellow] **Data Transformation:** Allows data to be adapted and cleaned before migrating to the target database.
*** **Data Enrichment:** Can involve enriching data with additional information during the transformation.
***[#orange] **Incremental Updates:** Supports incremental data updates over time.

**[#pink] Challenges
*** **Complexity: ** ETL processes can be complex and require careful design.
*** **Development Time:**  ETL processes may take longer to develop than other strategies.
*** **Maintenance: ** Ongoing maintenance of ETL pipelines is necessary.

* Phases of ETL Migration
** Data Extraction
*** Extract data from the source database, possibly using SQL queries or other data export methods.
*** Ensure data consistency and completeness during extraction.

** Data Transformation
*** Transform data to match the target schema, format, and data types.
*** May involve data cleansing, validation, and business rule implementation.

** Data Loading
*** Load the transformed data into the target database.
*** Perform data validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.

** Continuous Data Integration
*** Implement mechanisms for ongoing data synchronization between source and target databases.
*** Enable real-time or scheduled updates.

** Data Verification
*** Verify the data in the target database to ensure it aligns with the source data.
*** Confirm data consistency and accuracy.

* Considerations for ETL
**[#pink] Data Mapping
*** Develop detailed data mapping and transformation rules to guide the ETL process.
*** Account for differences in data structures and formats.

** Data Validation
*** Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity throughout the ETL pipeline.
*** Detect and address data inconsistencies.

** Rollback Plan
*** Develop a rollback plan to revert to the original database state in case of ETL process failures.
*** Safeguard against data corruption or loss.

** Performance Optimization
*** Optimize the performance of the ETL processes, including data transformation and loading.
*** Monitor and fine-tune ETL jobs.

* Best Practices
** Testing and Validation
*** Rigorously test ETL processes in a non-production environment to ensure data accuracy.
*** Validate application functionality with the new database.

** Documentation
*** Maintain detailed documentation of the ETL processes, including data mapping and transformation rules.
*** Document any issues and their resolutions.

** Communication
*** Communicate with stakeholders about the progress of ETL processes and any potential impacts.
*** Coordinate with application owners and users.

** Monitoring and Alerting
*** Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly address issues during ETL processes.
*** Detect and respond to data synchronization problems.
