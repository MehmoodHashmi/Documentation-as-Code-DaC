* ETL Strategy
** Description
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>The ETL strategy involves Extracting data from the source database, Transforming it to match the target schema, and Loading it into the new database.

**[#gold] Benefits
***[#orange] ====<size:13>**Data Transformation:** Allows data to be adapted and cleaned before migrating to the target database.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>**Data Enrichment:** Can involve enriching data with additional information during the transformation.
***[#gold] ====<size:13>**Incremental Updates:** Supports incremental data updates over time.

**[#pink] Challenges
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>**Complexity: ** ETL processes can be complex and require careful design.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>**Development Time:**  ETL processes may take longer to develop than other strategies.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>**Maintenance: ** Ongoing maintenance of ETL pipelines is necessary.

* Phases of ETL Migration
** Data Extraction
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Extract data from the source database, possibly using SQL queries or other data export methods.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Ensure data consistency and completeness during extraction.

** Data Transformation
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Transform data to match the target schema, format, and data types.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>May involve data cleansing, validation, and business rule implementation.

** Data Loading
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Load the transformed data into the target database.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Perform data validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.

** Continuous Data Integration
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement mechanisms for ongoing data synchronization between source and target databases.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Enable real-time or scheduled updates.

** Data Verification
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Verify the data in the target database to ensure it aligns with the source data.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Confirm data consistency and accuracy.

* Considerations for ETL
**[#pink] Data Mapping
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Develop detailed data mapping and transformation rules to guide the ETL process.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Account for differences in data structures and formats.

** Data Validation
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity throughout the ETL pipeline.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Detect and address data inconsistencies.

** Rollback Plan
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Develop a rollback plan to revert to the original database state in case of ETL process failures.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Safeguard against data corruption or loss.

** Performance Optimization
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Optimize the performance of the ETL processes, including data transformation and loading.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Monitor and fine-tune ETL jobs.

* Best Practices
** Testing and Validation
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Rigorously test ETL processes in a non-production environment to ensure data accuracy.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Validate application functionality with the new database.

** Documentation
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Maintain detailed documentation of the ETL processes, including data mapping and transformation rules.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Document any issues and their resolutions.

** Communication
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Communicate with stakeholders about the progress of ETL processes and any potential impacts.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Coordinate with application owners and users.

** Monitoring and Alerting
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement monitoring and alerting to promptly address issues during ETL processes.
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Detect and respond to data synchronization problems.
