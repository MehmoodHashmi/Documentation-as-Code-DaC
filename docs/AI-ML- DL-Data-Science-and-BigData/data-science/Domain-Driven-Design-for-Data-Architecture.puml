title =Domain-Driven Design for Data Architecture
!theme hacker

* Domain-Driven Design **(DDD)**
** Strategic Design
*** Bounded Contexts - Define boundaries for data ownership and context-specific models.
*** Ubiquitous Language - A shared language between domain experts and developers.
*** Context Mapping - Strategies for communication and integration between bounded contexts.
*** Core Domain - The primary focus of DDD within a bounded context.

** Tactical Design
*** Entity - Objects with identity and mutable state.
*** Value Object - Objects without identity, defined by their attributes.
*** Aggregate - A cluster of related entities and value objects treated as a single unit.
*** Repository - Manages the lifecycle of aggregates.
*** Services - Stateless domain logic that doesn't belong in entities or value objects.
*** Factories - Creates complex objects and aggregates.
*** Domain Events - Communication between domain objects.
*** Domain Services - Application-specific logic related to the domain.

**[#yellow] =Data Architecture
*** Read Models - Optimized data structures for querying.
*** Write Models - Data structures for updating the system.
*** Event Sourcing - Storing changes as a sequence of events.
*** CQRS **(Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** - Separating read and write models.
*** Data Storage - Databases, NoSQL stores, and storage mechanisms.
*** Event Store - A specialized database for storing domain events.
*** Messaging - Asynchronous communication between components.
*** Data Access Layer - Implementing data access for read and write models.

**[#yellow] Design Patterns
*** Aggregates and Repositories
*** Domain-Driven Design Patterns **(e.g., Specification, Entity, Value Object)**
*** Event-Driven Architecture Patterns
*** CQRS and Event Sourcing Patterns

**[#yellow] Tools and Frameworks
***[#gold] DDD Frameworks **(e.g., Axon Framework, EventStore, NEventStore)**
*** ORM **(Object-Relational Mapping)** tools
*** Message Brokers **(e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ)**
*** Data Storage Technologies **(e.g., SQL, NoSQL)**

** Challenges and Considerations
*** Consistency and Transactional Boundaries
*** Eventual Consistency
*** Scaling and Performance
*** Event Handling and Processing
*** Evolution of Domain Models
*** Testing Strategies in DDD

** Best Practices
*** Collaborative Modeling
*** Continuous Integration and Deployment
*** Versioning and Event Migration
*** Monitoring and Logging
*** Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

** Benefits of DDD in Data Architecture
*** Improved Data Modeling
*** Enhanced Domain Understanding
*** Maintainable and Scalable Systems
*** Better Collaboration Between Teams
*** Adaptability to Changing Requirements
