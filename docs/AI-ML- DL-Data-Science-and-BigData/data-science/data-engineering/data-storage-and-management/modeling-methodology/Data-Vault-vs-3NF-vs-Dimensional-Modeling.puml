* Data Vault vs 3NF vs Dimensional Modeling
**[#blue] ====[[Data-Vault.puml Data Vault]]
*** Overview
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data Vault is a data modeling methodology designed for data warehousing and analytics.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>It focuses on scalability, flexibility, auditability, and historical tracking of data.
***[#a] =Key Concepts
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Hub
***** Represents a business key or a unique identifier for an entity.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Link
***** Represents a many-to-many relationship between Hubs.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Satellite
***** Contains descriptive or contextual information about Hubs and Links.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Vault
***** Collection of interconnected Hubs, Links, and Satellites.
*** Benefits
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Scalability
***** Supports incremental data loading and parallel processing.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Flexibility
***** Adaptable to changes in business requirements.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Auditability
***** Tracks historical changes and provides traceability of data.
*** Challenges
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Complexity
***** Requires additional effort in data modeling and development.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Performance
***** May impact query performance due to schema complexity.
**[#crimson] ====**[[Third-Normal-Form-(3NF).puml 3NF (Third Normal Form)]]**
*** Overview
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>3NF is a data normalization technique that reduces data redundancy and ensures data integrity.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>It focuses on eliminating data anomalies and maintaining data consistency.
*** Key Concepts
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Entity
***** Represents a distinct real-world object or concept.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Attributes
***** Descriptive properties of an entity.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Relationships
***** Associations between entities.
*** Benefits
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data Integrity
***** Reduces data redundancy and ensures consistent data.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Relational Integrity
***** Supports complex relationships between entities.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data Consistency
***** Helps maintain data quality and accuracy.
*** Challenges
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Performance
***** May require complex joins and queries for data retrieval.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data Redundancy
***** Can result in larger data storage requirements.
**[#green] ====**[[../../../../../books/1-books-backlog/DBMS/Dimensional-Modeling.puml Dimensional Modeling]]**
*** Overview
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Dimensional Modeling is a data modeling technique for data warehousing and business intelligence.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>It focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and query performance.
***[#a] =Key Concepts
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Fact Table
***** Contains the numerical and measurable data (facts) related to a business process.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Dimension Table
***** Contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts in the Fact Table.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Star Schema
***** Consists of a central Fact Table connected to multiple Dimension Tables.
*** Benefits
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Query Performance
***** Optimized for analytical queries and aggregations.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Simplicity
***** Easy to understand and navigate for business users.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Performance
***** Efficient for reporting and ad-hoc analysis.
*** Challenges
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data Redundancy
***** Can result in duplicated data in Dimension Tables.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Limited Flexibility
***** Less adaptable to changes in business requirements.
