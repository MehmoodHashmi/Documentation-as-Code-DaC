* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
** Definition
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>A directed graph with no directed cycles
** Characteristics
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Consists of nodes and directed edges
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Nodes represent tasks or operations
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Edges represent dependencies between tasks
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>No circular dependencies are allowed
** Applications
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Data pipeline design and orchestration
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Task scheduling and dependency management
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Workflow management systems
** Benefits
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Enables parallel execution of independent tasks
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Provides clear visualization of task dependencies
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Facilitates efficient task scheduling and optimization
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Supports fault-tolerance and error handling
** Use Cases
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Batch processing workflows
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Machine learning pipelines
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Event-driven architectures
** Examples
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Apache Airflow
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Luigi
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Apache NiFi
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Apache Beam
** Best Practices
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Identify task dependencies and define the DAG structure
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Ensure there are no circular dependencies
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Optimize task execution order for efficiency
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Handle error and failure scenarios gracefully
***[#yellow] ====<size:13>Monitor and track task progress and dependencies
