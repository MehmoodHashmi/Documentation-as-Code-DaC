* =DAG Data Pipeline
** Definition
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>A data processing pipeline that uses a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** as its underlying structure
**[#gold] =Components
***[#orange] ====<size:12>**Source:** Provides the initial data to be processed
***[#orange] ====<size:12>**Transformation:** Applies operations and transformations on the data
***[#orange] ====<size:12>**Sink:** Stores or outputs the processed data
** Characteristics
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Task-based:** Each node in the DAG represents a specific task or operation
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Dependency-driven:** Edges define the data flow and dependencies between tasks
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Parallel execution: **Independent tasks can be executed concurrently
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Fault-tolerant:** Supports error handling and retries for task failures
** Advantages
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Scalability:** Can handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Flexibility:** Supports different types of data sources, transformations, and sinks
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Modularity:** Tasks can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the entire pipeline
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Reusability:** Common tasks or transformations can be shared across multiple pipelines
** Use Cases
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data ingestion and extraction
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data transformation and cleansing
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data aggregation and analytics
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Real-time streaming processing
** Tools and Frameworks
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Airflow
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache NiFi
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Beam
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Luigi
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>AWS Data Pipeline
** Best Practices
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Design a clear and well-defined DAG structure
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Identify and handle data dependencies between tasks
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Optimize task execution order for performance
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Monitor and log task progress and data flow
***[#yellow] ====<size:12>Implement error handling and retries for fault tolerance
