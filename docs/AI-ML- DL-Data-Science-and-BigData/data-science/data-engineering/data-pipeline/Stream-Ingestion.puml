* Stream Ingestion
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Stream ingestion** is the process of collecting and processing data in real-time or near-real-time as it flows from various sources into a data storage or processing system.

**[#gold] Objectives
*** Real-Time Data Collection
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Collect data immediately as it becomes available.
*** Continuous Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Process data on the fly as it streams in.
*** Low Latency
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Minimize the time between data generation and its availability for analysis.

**[#lime] Stream Ingestion Techniques
***[#orange] ===Data Streaming Platforms
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Use streaming platforms like **Apache Kafka** to ingest and process data in **real-time.**
***[#pink] ===Event-Driven Architecture
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Implement an event-driven architecture** for processing **data** as it **arrives.**
***[#red] ===[[Change-Data-Capture-(CDC).puml Change Data Capture (CDC)]]
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Capture and replicate changes from source systems in real-time.

** Stream Ingestion Tools
*** Apache Kafka
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
*** Apache Flink
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A stream processing framework for real-time data analytics.
*** AWS Kinesis
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A managed data streaming service for ingesting real-time data.

**[#a] Considerations
*** Data Sources
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identify and connect to various data sources producing real-time data.
*** Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Ensure that the stream ingestion process can handle growing data volumes.

*** Data Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Implement data encryption and access controls for real-time data.

** Best Practices
*** Data Schema
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define and enforce a data schema for incoming streams.
*** Error Handling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Establish robust error handling mechanisms for real-time data.
*** Monitoring and Alerting
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Set up continuous monitoring and alerting to detect issues in stream ingestion.
*** Stream Data Validation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Implement real-time data validation to ensure data quality.
