* Stream Processing vs. Batch Processing
** Stream Processing
*** Definition
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Stream processing refers to the real-time processing of continuous data streams, analyzing and acting on data as it is generated.
*** Key Characteristics
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Continuous and Real-time
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Infinite Data Streams
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Event-driven Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Low Latency
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Stateless and Parallel Processing
***[#gold] ==Use Cases
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Real-time Analytics
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Fraud Detection
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>IoT Data Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Clickstream Analysis
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Monitoring and Alerting
*** Technologies
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Kafka
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Flink
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Storm
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Spark Streaming
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Amazon Kinesis
** Batch Processing
*** Definition
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Batch processing refers to processing large volumes of data in discrete batches, analyzing and acting on data in fixed intervals or predefined time windows.
*** Key Characteristics
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Bulk Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Finite Data Sets
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Scheduled Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>High Throughput
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Stateful and Sequential Processing
*** Use Cases
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data Warehousing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Business Intelligence Reporting
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data Aggregation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data Archiving and Backup
*** Technologies
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Hadoop
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Spark
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Hive
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apache Pig
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Amazon EMR
** Considerations for Choosing Between Stream and Batch Processing
*** Data Freshness Requirements
*** Processing Latency
*** Data Volume and Velocity
*** Processing Complexity
*** Use Case and Application Requirements
*** Scalability and Resource Utilization
** **Hybrid Solutions:** Lambda Architecture
*** Definition
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Lambda architecture combines both stream and batch processing approaches to handle real-time and historical data processing.
*** Advantages
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Real-time and Historical Insights
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Fault Tolerance and Resilience
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Flexible and Extensible Architecture
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Polyglot Persistence
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Separation of Concerns
*** Challenges
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Complexity and Maintenance
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data Consistency and Synchronization
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Development and Deployment Overhead
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data Duplication and Storage Costs
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Skill and Expertise Requirements
