* Stream Processing
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Stream processing** is the real-time or near-real-time analysis and manipulation of data as it flows from various sources, allowing rapid insights and decision-making.

**[#lime] ====Objectives
*** Real-Time Analysis
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Analyze data as it arrives for immediate insights and actions.
*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Apply real-time transformations to data for processing and visualization.
*** Low Latency
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Minimize the time between data generation and actionable insights.

**[#orange] ==== Stream Processing Techniques
***[#a] ====**Event-Driven Architecture**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Process data based on events or triggers.
*** ====**Complex Event Processing (CEP)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Detect patterns and conditions in real-time data streams.
*** Real-Time Analytics
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Analyze data as it streams in, performing calculations and aggregations.

** Stream Processing Tools
*** Apache Kafka
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
*** Apache Flink
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A stream processing framework for real-time data analytics.
*** AWS Kinesis
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A managed data streaming service for ingesting and processing real-time data.

**[#gold] ==== Considerations
*** Data Sources
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identify and connect to real-time data sources, such as sensors and logs.
*** Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Ensure stream processing is scalable to handle high data volumes in real-time.
*** Data Versioning
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Plan for schema evolution and versioning in real-time data.

*** Data Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Implement access controls and encryption to protect real-time data.

** Best Practices
*** Data Schema
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define and enforce a data schema for incoming streams.
*** Error Handling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Develop robust error handling mechanisms for real-time data processing.
*** Monitoring and Alerting
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Set up continuous monitoring and alerting to detect and address stream processing problems.
*** Real-Time Data Validation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Implement real-time data validation to ensure data quality.
