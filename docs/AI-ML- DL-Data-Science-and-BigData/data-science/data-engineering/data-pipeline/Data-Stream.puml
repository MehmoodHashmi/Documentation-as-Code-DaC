*[#gold] =Data Stream

** Definition
*** Continuous flow of data records or events
*** Represents the movement of data from a source to a destination

**[#pink] =Characteristics
*** Continuity
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data stream is continuous and can be infinite in length
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>New data records are continuously added to the stream over time

*** Ordering
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data records in a stream may have a specific order or timestamp
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Processing often depends on preserving the order of records

*** Volume
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data streams can contain a large volume of data
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Handling large volumes may require scalable processing systems

*** Velocity
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data streams are processed in real-time or near real-time
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Processing speed and low latency are important for stream processing

**[#pink] **Use Cases**
*** Real-Time Analytics
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Stream processing enables immediate analysis and insights from data
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Fraud detection, stock market analysis, IoT data analysis

*** Event Sourcing and CQRS
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data streams can be used to capture and replay events for system state management
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Event-driven architectures, event sourcing patterns

*** Data Integration and ETL
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Streaming data allows continuous ingestion and transformation of data
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Data pipelines, data lakes, real-time data synchronization

**[#pink] **Technologies**
***[#pink] **Apache Kafka**
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Distributed streaming platform for handling high-volume, fault-tolerant data streams

*** Apache Flink
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Stream processing framework for distributed, fault-tolerant, and event-driven applications

*** Amazon Kinesis
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Managed streaming service for ingesting, processing, and analyzing data streams

*** Apache NiFi
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Data integration platform that supports real-time data streaming and processing

***[#pink] **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Messaging and event ingestion service for real-time data streaming
