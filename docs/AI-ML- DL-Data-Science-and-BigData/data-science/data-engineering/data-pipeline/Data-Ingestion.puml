* Data Ingestion
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Data ingestion** is the process of **collecting, importing, and transferring data** from **various sources into a data storage or processing system** for analysis or storage.

** Objectives
*** Collect Data
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Gather data from diverse sources, such as **databases, logs, files, and external APIs.**
*** Ensure Data Availability
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Make data accessible for analysis and decision-making.
*** Maintain Data Freshness
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Keep data up to date to support real-time or near-real-time analysis.

**[#a] Data Ingestion Techniques
***[#brown] **[[Batch-Ingestion.puml Batch Ingestion]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Collect and transfer **data** periodically in predefined batches.
***[#red] **[[Stream-Ingestion.puml Stream Ingestion]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Process and move **data** in real-time or near-real-time streams.
***[#blue] **[[Change-Data-Capture-(CDC).puml Change Data Capture (CDC)]]**
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Capture and replicate changes made to **data** sources in real-time.

** Data Ingestion Tools
*** Apache Nifi
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>An open-source **data** integration tool for routing and transforming data.
*** Kafka
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
*** AWS Glue
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A managed ETL service for ingesting and preparing data.

**[#pink] Considerations
*** Data Sources
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Identify and connect to various data sources, including databases, files, and APIs.
*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Determine whether data should be transformed during ingestion or after.
*** Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Ensure the ingestion process can handle growing data volumes.

*** Data Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Protect data during ingestion with encryption and access controls.

** Best Practices
*** Data Profiling
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Understand source data to prepare for ingestion.
*** Data Validation
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement validation checks to verify data integrity.
*** Error Handling
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Plan for handling errors and exceptions during ingestion.
*** Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and address issues.
