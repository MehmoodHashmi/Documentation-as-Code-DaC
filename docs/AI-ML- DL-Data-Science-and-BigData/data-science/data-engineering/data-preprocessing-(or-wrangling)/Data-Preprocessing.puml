*  Data Preprocessing \n=**(Wrangling)** \n**[[Data-Wrangling-(or-preprocessing).puml Click for detailed \nmindmap]]**
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Data preprocessing** is the process of **cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data** into a format suitable for analysis and modeling.

** Importance
*** **Enhances Data Quality:** Eliminates errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
*** **Improves Model Performance:** Quality data leads to more accurate and robust models.
*** **Facilitates Data Understanding:** Preprocessing aids in exploring and understanding the data.

**[#a] Steps in Data Preprocessing
***[#orange] ===Data Cleaning \n **[[1-Data-Cleaning.puml Click for detailed \nmindmap]]**
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Handle Missing Values:** Remove, impute, or interpolate missing data.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Outlier Detection:** Identify and handle outliers that can distort analysis.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Noise Reduction:** Smooth noisy data by applying filters or techniques.

***[#gold] ===Data Transformation \n **[[2-Data-Transformation.puml Click for detailed \nmindmap]]**
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Encoding Categorical Data:** Convert categorical variables into numerical formats **(e.g., one-hot encoding)**.
****[#darkorange] <i><color #black><size:21>**[[Feature-Scaling.puml Feature Scaling:]]** Normalize or standardize numeric features to bring them to a common scale.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce the number of features using techniques like **PCA.**

***[#pink] ===Data Reduction \n **[[3-Data-Reduction.puml Click for detailed \nmindmap]]**
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Sampling:** Reduce data volume by sampling subsets **(e.g., random or stratified sampling)**.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Aggregation:** Combine and summarize data to reduce dimensionality **(e.g., aggregating by time intervals)**.

***[#lime] ===Data Integration \n **[[4-Data-Integration.puml Click for detailed \nmindmap]]**
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Merge Data Sources:** Combine data from multiple sources into a single **dataset**.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Handle Redundancy:** Identify and eliminate redundant information.

** Tools and Techniques
*** Data Analysis Tools
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Python Libraries:** pandas, NumPy
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>R Data Analysis Tools

** Considerations
***[#orange] ===Domain Knowledge
****[#yellow] ===Understanding the domain is crucial for effective preprocessing.
****[#yellow] ===Domain knowledge helps in handling specific data challenges.

*** Data Documentation
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Maintain clear documentation of preprocessing steps to ensure reproducibility.

*** Data Splitting
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Split data into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

***[#gold] ===Iterative Process
****[#yellow] ===__Data preprocessing__ is often an iterative process, as new insights may require adjustments.

* Best Practices
** Start with Data Exploration
*** Explore data visually and statistically to identify issues.

** Handle Missing Values Appropriately
*** Choose suitable imputation techniques based on the nature of the data.

** Visualize Data Distribution
*** Understand data distribution to make informed decisions on feature scaling.

** Keep Original Data Intact
*** Save a copy of the original data before preprocessing for reference.

** Evaluate Model Performance
*** Assess how preprocessing impacts model performance.
