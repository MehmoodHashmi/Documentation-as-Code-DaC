* Data Cleaning
** Definition
*** Data cleaning is the process of identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data to improve its quality and reliability.

** Importance
*** **Ensures Data Quality:** High-quality data is vital for accurate analysis and decision-making.
*** **Enhances Credibility:** Clean data increases trust in reports and insights.
*** **Minimizes Errors:** Reduces the likelihood of errors in downstream processes.

** Data Cleaning Techniques
*** Handling Missing Values
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Imputation:** Replacing missing values with estimated values (mean, median, mode).
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Removal:** Eliminating rows or columns with excessive missing data.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Interpolation:** Estimating missing values based on surrounding data points.

*** Outlier Detection and Treatment
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Identifying outliers that significantly deviate from the norm.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Treatment methods may include removal, transformation, or imputation.

*** Data Deduplication
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Detecting and removing duplicate records or observations.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Ensures data integrity and prevents double-counting.

*** Standardizing Data
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Consistent formatting of data (e.g., date formats, capitalization).
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Normalizing units and scales for uniformity.

** Data Cleaning Tools
*** OpenRefine
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>A powerful tool for data cleaning and transformation.

*** pandas (Python library)
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Popular for data cleaning and manipulation in Python.

*** Excel
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Basic data cleaning operations can be performed using Excel.

** Considerations
*** Data Profiling
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Understanding the characteristics and distribution of data.

*** Data Validation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Implementing data validation checks to catch errors early.

*** Automation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Developing automated data cleaning processes for efficiency.

*** Documentation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Maintaining documentation of data cleaning steps for reproducibility.

** Best Practices
*** Data Auditing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Regularly audit and monitor data quality.

*** Version Control
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Apply version control to data cleaning scripts and processes.

*** Data Backups
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Make backups before performing extensive data cleaning.

*** Collaboration
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Collaborate with domain experts and stakeholders to validate data changes.
