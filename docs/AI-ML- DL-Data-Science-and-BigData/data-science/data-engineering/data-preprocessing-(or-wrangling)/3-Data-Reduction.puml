* Data Reduction
** Definition
*** Data reduction is the process of reducing the volume, complexity, and size of data while retaining the most relevant and valuable information for analysis or storage.

** Objectives
*** Minimize Data Volume
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Reduce data size to save storage and processing resources.
*** Improve Data Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Streamline data processing by focusing on essential information.
*** Enhance Analysis Efficiency
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Make data analysis more efficient by eliminating noise and redundancy.

** Data Reduction Techniques
*** Data Sampling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Select a representative subset of data for analysis.
****[#white] ====<size:14>**Methods:** Random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling.

*** Aggregation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Summarize data by grouping and applying functions **(e.g., average, sum)**.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Reduce granularity while retaining key information.

*** Dimensionality Reduction
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Reduce the number of features or dimensions in data.
****[#white] ====<size:14>**Techniques:** Principal Component Analysis **(PCA)**, t-SNE, feature selection.

*** Binning
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Categorize continuous data into bins or intervals.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Reduce data variability and maintain trends.

**[#orange] Data Reduction Tools
***[#gold] **Data Warehousing**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data warehousing solutions often include data reduction capabilities.

*** Database Management Systems **(DBMS)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>DBMS provides functions for aggregating and sampling data.

*** Big Data Processing Frameworks
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tools like Apache Spark offer data reduction capabilities.

** Considerations
*** Loss of Information
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data reduction may result in loss of less significant details.

*** Data Structure
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Understand data structure to select appropriate reduction techniques.

*** Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Ensure that data reduction techniques are scalable to handle large datasets.

*** Downstream Impact
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Consider the impact of data reduction on downstream processes.

** Best Practices
***[#pink] **Data Sampling Plan**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Create a well-defined sampling plan with clear objectives.

*** Data Profiling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Profile data to understand its characteristics and distribution.

*** Documentation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Maintain documentation of data reduction processes for reproducibility.

*** Evaluation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Assess the impact of data reduction on analysis and performance.
