* Data Processing
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Data processing** is the **transformation, aggregation, analysis, and manipulation** of **data** to **extract insights, generate reports, and support decision-making.**

**[#a] Objectives
*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Convert data into a format suitable for analysis and reporting.
*** Data Analysis
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Extract meaningful insights and patterns from data.
*** Real-Time Processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Process and analyze data as it arrives for real-time decision-making.
*** Reporting
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Generate reports and visualizations for communication.

**[#gold] Data Processing Techniques
***[#gold] **Batch Processing**
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Process data in predefined batches, suitable for large volumes of historical data.
***[#orange] **Stream Processing**
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Analyze data in real-time or near-real-time streams.
***[#pink] **Big Data Processing**
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Utilize big data technologies for handling large and complex datasets.

**[#lime] Data Processing Tools
*** Apache Spark
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A powerful **open-source framework** for **batch and stream processing.**
*** Apache Flink
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A **stream processing framework** for **real-time data analytics.**
***[#gold] ===Hadoop
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A **distributed processing framework** for **big data.**

**[#lightgreen] Considerations
*** Data Complexity
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Understand the complexity of data and the required processing techniques.
*** Data Volume
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Ensure that data processing is scalable to handle large volumes of data.

*** Data Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Protect data during processing with encryption and access controls.

*** Data Quality
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement data validation and quality checks during processing.

** Best Practices
*** Data Processing Workflows
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Develop well-defined workflows for data processing tasks.
*** Data Validation
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity.
*** Error Handling
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Plan for error detection, logging, and recovery during data processing.
*** Monitoring and Alerting
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Set up continuous monitoring and alerting for data processing pipelines.
