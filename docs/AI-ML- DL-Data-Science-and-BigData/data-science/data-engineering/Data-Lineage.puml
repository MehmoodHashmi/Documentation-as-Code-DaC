 * Data Lineage
 ** Definition
 ***[#white] ====<size:15>**Data Lineage** refers to the "end-to-end tracking" of "data" as it flows through an "organization's systems", from its "source to its destination", including "transformations and dependencies".

 ** Key Concepts
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Source
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>The origin of data, such as databases, files, or APIs.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Operations and processes that modify or manipulate data.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Destination
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Where data is consumed, used, or stored.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Dependency
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Relationships and connections between data elements.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Metadata
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Information about data, including its attributes and characteristics.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Flow
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>The path data takes from source to destination.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Versioning
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tracking different versions of data.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Quality
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Assessing data accuracy and consistency.

 ** Types of Data Lineage
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Forward Data Lineage
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tracking data from source to destination.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Backward Data Lineage
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identifying data sources for a given dataset.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Impact Analysis
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Assessing the effects of changes on data elements.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Horizontal Lineage
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data flow across similar processing stages.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Vertical Lineage
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Data flow through different processing stages.

 ** Data Lineage Tools
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Catalogs
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tools for metadata management and lineage tracking.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>ETL **Extract, Transform, Load)** Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>ETL platforms that document data transformations.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Integration Platforms
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Solutions that integrate data from various sources.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Governance Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tools for managing data policies and standards.

 ** Use Cases
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Compliance
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Demonstrating compliance with data regulations.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Quality Management
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identifying issues and improving data quality.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Impact Analysis
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Assessing the consequences of changes on data.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Auditing
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tracking data changes for auditing and governance.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Analytics
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Understanding data flows for analysis.

 ** Data Lineage Challenges
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Complex Data Flows
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Managing intricate data paths in large organizations.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Unstructured Data
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Handling unstructured data sources.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Legacy Systems
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tracking data in older, non-standard systems.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Real-time Lineage
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Capturing data flow in real-time environments.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Versioning
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Managing and tracking different data versions.

 ** Benefits of Data Lineage
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Transparency
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Providing a clear view of data movement and transformations.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Data Accountability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identifying responsible parties for data accuracy.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Compliance Assurance
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Meeting regulatory requirements through lineage documentation.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Improved Data Quality
