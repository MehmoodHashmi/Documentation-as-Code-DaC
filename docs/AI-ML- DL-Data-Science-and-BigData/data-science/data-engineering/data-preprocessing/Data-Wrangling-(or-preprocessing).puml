* Data Wrangling

** Definition
*** The process of transforming and cleaning raw data into a suitable format for analysis.

** Steps

*** Data Acquisition
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Collecting data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files, or web scraping.

*** Data Cleaning
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Converting data into a more structured or usable form.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Reshaping data, converting data types, merging or joining datasets.

*** Data Integration
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset.

*** Data Aggregation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Summarizing or aggregating data based on certain criteria.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Grouping data, calculating averages, counts, or other statistics.

*** Feature Engineering
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Creating new features or variables from existing data.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Creating dummy variables, extracting information from text or timestamps.

*** Data Validation and Quality Checks
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and validity.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Examples:** Cross-validation, data profiling, checking data integrity.

** Tools

*** Python Libraries
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**pandas:** Powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**NumPy:** Fundamental package for scientific computing with multi-dimensional arrays.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**scikit-**learn: Machine learning library with tools for data preprocessing.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**Dask:** Parallel computing library for big data processing.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**SQLAlchemy:** SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**BeautifulSoup:** Web scraping library for extracting data from HTML and XML.

*** R Libraries
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**dplyr:** Data manipulation library with a grammar of data manipulation.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**tidyr:** Tools for reshaping and tidying data.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**plyr:** Tools for splitting, applying, and combining data.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**data.table:** Fast data manipulation library optimized for performance.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**stringr:** String manipulation library for text data.
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**XML:** Parsing and generating XML and HTML data.

*** SQL
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Structured Query Language for managing and manipulating relational databases.

*** Command Line Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>**grep, sed, awk:** Command-line tools for searching, editing, and transforming text.

** Challenges

*** Missing Data
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Handling missing values, determining appropriate strategies for imputation.

*** Data Inconsistencies
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Dealing with inconsistent formats, units, or naming conventions.

*** Data Volume and Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Processing and manipulating large datasets efficiently.

*** Data Quality Issues
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Detecting and resolving errors, outliers, or inconsistent data.

*** Data Security and Privacy
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

** Best Practices

*** Data Understanding
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Gaining a deep understanding of the data and its characteristics.

*** Documentation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Documenting data sources, assumptions, and transformations for reproducibility.

*** Iterative Approach
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Iteratively refining and validating data wrangling steps.

*** Automation
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Automating data wrangling processes to improve efficiency and consistency.

*** Version Control
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Using version control systems to track changes in data and code.

*** Collaboration
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Collaborating with domain experts and data stakeholders for better data quality.
