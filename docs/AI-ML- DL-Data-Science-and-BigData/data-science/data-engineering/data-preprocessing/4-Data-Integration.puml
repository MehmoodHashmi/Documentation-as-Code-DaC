* Data Integration
** Definition
*** Data integration is the process of combining, aligning, and presenting data from multiple sources in a unified and cohesive manner to support decision-making and analysis.

** Objectives
*** Unified Data View
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Provide a single, consistent view of data from diverse sources.
*** Improve Data Quality
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability.
*** Support Decision-Making
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Enable data-driven decision-making by providing a holistic view of information.

**[#lime] Data Integration Techniques
***[#gold] ===Data Warehousing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Centralized storage of integrated data for reporting and analysis.

***[#orange] ====**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Extract data from source systems, transform it to the target schema, and load it into a data warehouse.

***[#pink] ===Data Virtualization
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Present data from multiple sources in real-time without physically moving it.

***[#c] ===Master Data Management (MDM)
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Create a single, master record for critical data elements (e.g., customer or product data).

**[#orange] Data Integration Tools
*** ETL Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Talend, Informatica PowerCenter, Apache Nifi.

*** Data Warehousing Platforms
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake.

*** Data Virtualization Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Denodo, Cisco Data Virtualization, Informatica.

*** Master Data Management (MDM) Solutions
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Informatica MDM, IBM InfoSphere MDM.

** Considerations
*** Data Quality
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Ensure integrated data maintains high quality and consistency.

*** Data Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Protect data during integration with encryption and access controls.

*** Data Governance
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Establish governance policies and standards for data integration.

*** Data Lineage
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Track the origin and history of data elements for traceability.

** Best Practices
*** Data Profiling
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Understand source data to identify issues and transformation needs.

*** Incremental Updates
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Implement mechanisms for incremental data integration to reduce load times.

*** Data Auditing
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Audit and monitor data integration processes for data quality.

*** Collaboration
****[#yellow] ====<size:12>Collaborate with data stakeholders to align data integration with business objectives.
