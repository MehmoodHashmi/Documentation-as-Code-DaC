* Data Wrangling

** Definition
*** The process of transforming and cleaning raw data into a suitable format for analysis.

** Steps

*** Data Acquisition
****[#yellow] ====Collecting data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files, or web scraping.

*** Data Cleaning
****[#yellow] ====Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

*** Data Transformation
****[#yellow] ====Converting data into a more structured or usable form.
****[#yellow] ====**Examples:** Reshaping data, converting data types, merging or joining datasets.

*** Data Integration
****[#yellow] ====Combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset.

*** Data Aggregation
****[#yellow] ====Summarizing or aggregating data based on certain criteria.
****[#yellow] ====**Examples:** Grouping data, calculating averages, counts, or other statistics.

*** Feature Engineering
****[#yellow] ====Creating new features or variables from existing data.
****[#yellow] ====**Examples:** Creating dummy variables, extracting information from text or timestamps.

*** Data Validation and Quality Checks
****[#yellow] ====Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and validity.
****[#yellow] ====**Examples:** Cross-validation, data profiling, checking data integrity.

** Tools

*** Python Libraries
****[#yellow] ====pandas: Powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
****[#yellow] ====NumPy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with multi-dimensional arrays.
****[#yellow] ====scikit-learn: Machine learning library with tools for data preprocessing.
****[#yellow] ====Dask: Parallel computing library for big data processing.
****[#yellow] ====SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
****[#yellow] ====BeautifulSoup: Web scraping library for extracting data from HTML and XML.

*** R Libraries
****[#yellow] ====dplyr: Data manipulation library with a grammar of data manipulation.
****[#yellow] ====tidyr: Tools for reshaping and tidying data.
****[#yellow] ====plyr: Tools for splitting, applying, and combining data.
****[#yellow] ====data.table: Fast data manipulation library optimized for performance.
****[#yellow] ====stringr: String manipulation library for text data.
****[#yellow] ====XML: Parsing and generating XML and HTML data.

*** SQL
****[#yellow] ====Structured Query Language for managing and manipulating relational databases.

*** Command Line Tools
****[#yellow] ====grep, sed, awk: Command-line tools for searching, editing, and transforming text.

** Challenges

*** Missing Data
****[#yellow] ====Handling missing values, determining appropriate strategies for imputation.

*** Data Inconsistencies
****[#yellow] ====Dealing with inconsistent formats, units, or naming conventions.

*** Data Volume and Scalability
****[#yellow] ====Processing and manipulating large datasets efficiently.

*** Data Quality Issues
****[#yellow] ====Detecting and resolving errors, outliers, or inconsistent data.

*** Data Security and Privacy
****[#yellow] ====Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

** Best Practices

*** Data Understanding
****[#yellow] ====Gaining a deep understanding of the data and its characteristics.

*** Documentation
****[#yellow] ====Documenting data sources, assumptions, and transformations for reproducibility.

*** Iterative Approach
****[#yellow] ====Iteratively refining and validating data wrangling steps.

*** Automation
****[#yellow] ====Automating data wrangling processes to improve efficiency and consistency.

*** Version Control
****[#yellow] ====Using version control systems to track changes in data and code.

*** Collaboration
****[#yellow] ====Collaborating with domain experts and data stakeholders for better data quality.
