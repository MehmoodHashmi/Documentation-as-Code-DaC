** Stream Processing
*** Definition
**** Continuous processing of data records as they arrive
**** Enables real-time analytics and immediate response to data

*** Techniques
**** Windowing
***** Divides the data stream into finite, overlapping or non-overlapping time intervals for analysis
***** Examples: Tumbling windows, sliding windows

**** Joining and Aggregation
***** Combines multiple data streams based on shared attributes or keys
***** Performs aggregation operations on the combined data
***** Examples: Joining customer data with sales data, computing sum or average

**** Complex Event Processing (CEP)
***** Identifies patterns and correlations in the data stream
***** Allows detection of complex events or situations
***** Examples: Fraud detection, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance
