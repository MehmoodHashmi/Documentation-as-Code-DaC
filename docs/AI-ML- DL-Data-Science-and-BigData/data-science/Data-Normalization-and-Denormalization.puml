* Data Normalization and Denormalization
**[#a] =Data Normalization
*** Purpose
**** Eliminate Data Redundancy
**** Minimize Data Anomalies
**** Improve Data Integrity
**** Support Database Consistency
*** Normal Forms
**** First Normal Form (1NF)
**** Second Normal Form (2NF)
**** Third Normal Form (3NF)
**** Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
**** Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
**** Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
**** Domain-Key Normal Form (DK/NF)
*** Normalization Process
**** Identify Functional Dependencies
**** Decompose Data into Tables
**** Establish Relationships with Primary and Foreign Keys
**** Eliminate Redundant Data
**** Verify Normalization Rules
