* Apache Beam

** Definition
*** <size:14>**Unified programming model** for building **batch and streaming data processing pipelines**
*** <size:14>Provides a high-level API for data parallelism and distributed processing

**[#lime] Key Concepts

***[#gold] ==Pipelines
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Represents a data processing workflow or computation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Consists of a series of transformations and operations on input data

***[#pink] PCollection **(Parallel Collection)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Represents a distributed collection of elements in a pipeline
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Acts as input or output for transformations within the pipeline

*** Transformations
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Operations that modify or process data in a PCollection
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Examples:** Map, Filter, GroupByKey, Combine, Window

*** Sources and Sinks
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Sources: Represents input data sources for a pipeline
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Sinks: Represents output destinations or sinks for pipeline results

***[#orange] PTransforms **(Parallel Transforms)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>High-level operations that encapsulate one or more transformations
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Enables composability and reuse of data processing logic

** Execution Engines

*** Apache Flink
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Distributed stream processing engine with support for batch processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Provides fault-tolerance, scalability, and high-throughput processing

*** Apache Spark
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>General-purpose distributed computing engine with support for batch and stream processing
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Offers in-memory processing, fault tolerance, and a rich set of built-in libraries

*** Google Cloud Dataflow
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Fully managed service for executing Apache Beam pipelines on the Google Cloud Platform
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Provides automatic scaling, monitoring, and job management capabilities

** Ecosystem and Integration

*** Integration with Data Processing Frameworks
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, Apache Cassandra, etc.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Allows reading from and writing to various data storage and messaging systems

*** Language SDKs
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Provides language-specific APIs and SDKs for writing Apache Beam pipelines
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Includes Java, Python, Go, and other community-supported languages

*** Community and Tooling
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Active and growing open-source community around Apache Beam
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Provides documentation, tutorials, and a range of tools for development and monitoring
