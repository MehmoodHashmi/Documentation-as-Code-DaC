title =__ Apache Beam Library__

* **Apache Beam Library**


** Definition
*** Open-source, **unified programming model** and set of libraries for **building data processing pipelines**
***[#pink] Provides a rich ecosystem of connectors, transformations, and utilities for batch and streaming processing

** **Core Components**

*** SDKs (Software Development Kits)
**** Language-specific SDKs for writing Apache Beam pipelines
**** Provides language bindings and APIs for different programming languages

***[#pink] **Runners**
**** **Execution engines** that run __Apache Beam pipelines on various distributed processing platforms__
**** **Examples:** Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Google Cloud Dataflow

*** IO Connectors
**** Connectors for reading from and writing to various data sources and sinks
**** **Examples:** Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, Apache Cassandra

** Transformations and Utilities

*** **Core Transformations**
****[#pink] **Map:** Applies a function to each element in a PCollection
****[#pink] **Filter:** Filters elements based on a given predicate
****[#pink] **GroupByKey:** Groups elements with the same key into a single collection
****[#pink] **Combine:** Combines elements using a user-defined function

*** Windowing Transformations
**** **Fixed Windows:** Divides data into fixed-size, non-overlapping time windows
**** **Sliding Windows:** Overlaps adjacent windows by a specified duration
**** **Session Windows:** Groups data into windows based on gaps between events

*** Advanced Transformations
**** **ParDo: ** Allows flexible data processing and transformations with user-defined functions
**** **Stateful Processing:**  Enables maintaining and updating state across multiple elements
**** **Timers: ** Allows setting timers for future processing based on event time or processing time

*** **Utilities**
**** **I/O Utilities:** Provide common functions and abstractions for input/output operations
**** **Metrics:** Enables monitoring and collecting metrics during pipeline execution
**** **Windowing Functions:** Predefined functions for window-based computations

** Ecosystem and Integration

*** Apache Beam Community
**** Active and growing open-source community around Apache Beam
**** Provides support, documentation, and contributions to the project

*** Integration with Apache Projects
**** Integration with various Apache projects for seamless data processing workflows
**** **Examples:** Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, Apache Cassandra

*** Integration with External Systems
**** Connectors for integrating with external systems and services
**** **Examples:** Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, BigQuery, Elasticsearch
