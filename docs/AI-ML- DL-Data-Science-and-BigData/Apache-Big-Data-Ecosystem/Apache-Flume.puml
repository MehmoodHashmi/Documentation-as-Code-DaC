* Apache Flume
** Overview
*** Distributed, Reliable, and Scalable **Data Ingestion Tool**
*** Designed for Streaming Log Data and **Event Processing**
*** Part of the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem

**[#pink] ==**Architecture** \n<img:images/img_2.png>
*** Sources
**** Data Producers or Providers
**** e.g., Logs, Files, Sensors, Network Streams
*** **Channels**
**** Buffers Data Between Sources and Sinks
**** Ensures Reliable Data Transfer
**** Provides Fault Tolerance
*** Sinks
**** Data Destinations
**** e.g., Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), HBase, Kafka, Elasticsearch
*** **Agents** \n<img:images/img_3.png>
**** Flume Components Configured for Data Flow
**** Collect Data from Sources and Send to Sinks

*** **Flume event** \n<img:images/img_4.png>
**** An **event** is the basic unit of the data transported inside Flume.
****:It contains a payload of byte array that is to be transported from
the source to the destination accompanied by optional headers.;

** Features
*** Data Collection
**** Ingests Data from Various Sources
**** Supports Log Data, Events, and Stream Processing
*** Reliability and Fault Tolerance
**** Guarantees Reliable Data Transfer
**** Provides Fault Recovery and Error Handling
*** Scalability and Flexibility
**** Scales Horizontally Across Multiple Agents
**** Allows Dynamic Configuration Changes
*** Event Driven Architecture
**** Processes Data in Real Time
**** Supports Event-Based Flows
*** Data Transformation and Enrichment
**** Allows Data Manipulation in Flight
**** Customizable Interceptors for Data Enrichment
*** Extensible
**** Supports Custom Sources, Channels, and Sinks
**** Integration with External Systems
**** Custom Plugins and Components

** Use Cases
*** Log Collection and Analysis
*** Real-Time Stream Processing
*** Data Ingestion into Hadoop Ecosystem
*** Data Pipeline and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Flows
*** Centralized Data Collection and Aggregation

** Integration with Apache Hadoop Ecosystem
*** Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
*** Apache HBase
