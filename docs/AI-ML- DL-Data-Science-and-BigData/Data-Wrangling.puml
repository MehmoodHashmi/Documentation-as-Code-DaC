* Data Wrangling

** Definition
*** The process of transforming and cleaning raw data into a suitable format for analysis.

** Steps

*** Data Acquisition
**** Collecting data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files, or web scraping.

*** Data Cleaning
**** Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

*** Data Transformation
**** Converting data into a more structured or usable form.
**** Examples: Reshaping data, converting data types, merging or joining datasets.

*** Data Integration
**** Combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset.

*** Data Aggregation
**** Summarizing or aggregating data based on certain criteria.
**** Examples: Grouping data, calculating averages, counts, or other statistics.

*** Feature Engineering
**** Creating new features or variables from existing data.
**** Examples: Creating dummy variables, extracting information from text or timestamps.

*** Data Validation and Quality Checks
**** Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and validity.
**** Examples: Cross-validation, data profiling, checking data integrity.

** Tools

*** Python Libraries
**** pandas: Powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
**** NumPy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with multi-dimensional arrays.
**** scikit-learn: Machine learning library with tools for data preprocessing.
**** Dask: Parallel computing library for big data processing.
**** SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
**** BeautifulSoup: Web scraping library for extracting data from HTML and XML.

*** R Libraries
**** dplyr: Data manipulation library with a grammar of data manipulation.
**** tidyr: Tools for reshaping and tidying data.
**** plyr: Tools for splitting, applying, and combining data.
**** data.table: Fast data manipulation library optimized for performance.
**** stringr: String manipulation library for text data.
**** XML: Parsing and generating XML and HTML data.

*** SQL
**** Structured Query Language for managing and manipulating relational databases.

*** Command Line Tools
**** grep, sed, awk: Command-line tools for searching, editing, and transforming text.

** Challenges

*** Missing Data
**** Handling missing values, determining appropriate strategies for imputation.

*** Data Inconsistencies
**** Dealing with inconsistent formats, units, or naming conventions.

*** Data Volume and Scalability
**** Processing and manipulating large datasets efficiently.

*** Data Quality Issues
**** Detecting and resolving errors, outliers, or inconsistent data.

*** Data Security and Privacy
**** Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

** Best Practices

*** Data Understanding
**** Gaining a deep understanding of the data and its characteristics.

*** Documentation
**** Documenting data sources, assumptions, and transformations for reproducibility.

*** Iterative Approach
**** Iteratively refining and validating data wrangling steps.

*** Automation
**** Automating data wrangling processes to improve efficiency and consistency.

*** Version Control
**** Using version control systems to track changes in data and code.

*** Collaboration
**** Collaborating with domain experts and data stakeholders for better data quality.
