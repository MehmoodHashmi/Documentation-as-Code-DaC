== 6-step process for classification and regression type problems

A 6-step process for *_classification and #regression# type problems_*, the common problem types at the heart of most machine learning problems. The process is as follows:

Applied Machine Learning Process

. *Problem Definition:* Understand and clearly describe the problem that is being solved.
. *Analyze Data:* Understand the information available that will be used to develop a model.
. *Prepare Data:* Discover and expose the structure in the dataset.
. *Evaluate Algorithms:* Develop a robust test harness and baseline accuracy from which to improve and spot check algorithms.
. *Improve Results:* Leverage results to develop more accurate models.
. *Present Results:* Describe the problem and solution so that it can be understood by third parties.

Machine Learning problems can be solved in numerous ways, and you can *#choose algorithms#* based on several factors like *#accuracy, objective, size, and nature of data#*. You can refer the cheat sheet and get a head start in building the model. Once, you have implemented the solution and got results then you can further explore different algorithms to see what is the best algorithm that is suited for that particular problem.

.*Choosing the right estimator*

Often the hardest part of solving a machine learning problem can be finding the right *_##estimator##_* for the job. Different estimators are better suited for different types of data and different problems. The flowchart below is designed to give users a bit of a rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which estimators to try on your data.
