title =__//Finding the Center of a Data Set. Mean, Median, Mode//__

*[#red] Lecture-3 Part-1: **Finding the Center of a Data Set. Mean, Median, Mode**
** we are on Chapter-3 and will study **describing data**


* <size: 22>**5-Characteristics of "describing" data**
** **1- Center**
** **2- Variation**
** **3- Distribution** (data is normally distributed or not)
** **4- Outlier** (if there are outlier in the data)
*** = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, <size:22>**300**, </size>14,  Actually this **300 is outlier**
** **5- Any changes over time**


* =**1- Center**
** **Definition:** What's happening most often, by what value\n data is mostly surrounded OR The **middle** of the data set
*** **3-ways to find __center__:**
**** **1- Mean:** is Arithmetic average, add all the values and divide the by the total number\n of values you added\n<img:images/img_12.png>
***** **Mean** is affected by the **outliers** data
**** **2- Median:** is the \n**middle value** of the  **data set**
***** **data:** must be in **order,** otherwise your **middle number** \nwill not necessarily be the middle of your **data set**
***** **Median** is not affected by the **outliers** data
***** find middle value
******[#pink] =2-cases:
******* **even** number of data values:
******** **Median** is the **mean** of two middle numbers after the data values are in order\ne.g. 1,2, **3, 4**,5,6 Here (3+4)/2 is median
******* **odd** number of data values:
******** **Median** is the middle number after the data values are in order\ne.g. 1,2, **3,** 4,5 Here 3 is median
**** **3- Mode:** Most commonly occurring data value. e.g. 1, 2 ,2, **3,3,3,** 4,5,6. In this example **mode is 3.**
**** __Making up frequency distributions__ and __calculating the mean of those frequency distributions__ and calculating the mean of weighted distributions
****[#gold] <size: 22>**skewed:**</size>
***** **skewed right:** meaning most** outliers** exists on right side of graph\n<img:images/img_13.png>
***** **skewed left:** meaning most **outliers** exists on left side of graph\n<img:images/img_14.png>
***** **Normal:** not bad data \n<img:images/img_15.png>
******[#white] <size:22>**Empirical Rule:**</size> if a **data set** is **normally distributed,** \nonly then we can use the **empirical rule**\n<img:images/img_22.png>
*******:==**Definition:** if a **data set** is **normally distributed,** then:
* <size:16>**68%** of the **data** will <color #green>**fall within**</color> **one __standard deviation__** of the **mean**
* <size:16>**95%** of the **data** will <color #green>**fall within**</color> **tow __standard deviation__** of the **mean**
* <size:16>**99.7%** of the **data** will <color #green>**fall within**</color> **three __standard deviation__** of the **mean**
<img:images/img_24.png>;


*******[#pink]:If a **data value** is within **(tow or 2)** __standard deviation__ of the **mean**, that is
considered <size:22>**"usual"**,</size> any **data value** outside of the **(tow or 2)** __standard deviation__
will be considered as <size:22>**"unusual"**</size>;

*******[#gold]:A **data value** outside of **(three or 3)** __standard deviation__ of the **mean**, is very <size:22>**rare.**</size>
**Example:**
<img:images/img_19.png>;

*:=The __z-score__ can be perfectly found in a __normal distribution curve__ with no __left skew and right skew.__ The below image shows these curves.

**[#red] Lecture-3 Part-3: **Finding the Standard Deviation of a Data Set**
***[#red] Lecture-3 Part-4: **Finding Z-Score, Percentiles and Quartiles, and Comparing Standard Deviation**


* =**2- Variations**
**:=**Definition:** how data is spread apart
----
We need to have some way to represent what have more spread.
We have **two ways** to do it:

# **Coefficient of variation**
# **Z-score**
==**OR**==
=Measure of relative standing
* **comparing measures** between or within the **data set/values**;

***:<size:18>**1- Coefficient of variation:**</size> which translates __**standard deviation**__ <color #green>**comparison**</color> to its **mean** to a **percentage (%)**
<img:images/img_20.png>
It does not says **height** varies **4.6%** more than **weight**, it is just  a way to <color #lime>**compare**</color>
__height and weight__.

Observe, even though the number of **standard deviation** is smaller for the **height; s=3,**
in-spite of this the **coefficient of variation = 4.6%** is larger;

***:<size:18>**2- Z-score:**</size> The number of **standard deviations** a **data value (x-axis)** is away from the **mean**
= [[https://medium.com/pythoneers/z-distribution-or-z-score-application-in-machine-learning-fbba081cd9fe]]
<img:images/img_21.png>
* allows comparison of the variation in two different samples or population
=When you questions like: who is relatively:
* taller
* longer
* larger
* heavier
* lighter
* etc.
=Use Z-Score for populations
====
<size:19>The process of converting **raw observations** into Z-score is also called as **standardization or normalization.**
<size:19>When the **mean and standard deviation** of a **data set** are known, it is easy to convert them into **Z-score** for
<size:19>that particular sample or population. The figure below represents different values of Z-scores. Note that Z = +1
<size:19>represents that the observation is 1 standard deviation away from mean in the positive direction. In the same
<size:19>way, Z=-1 represents that the observation is 1 standard deviation away from mean in the negative direction.
<img:images/img_25.png>

<size:22> A **Z-Score** between -2 and 2 is considered as **"usual"**
<size:22> A **Z-Score** less than -2 or greater than 2 is considered as **"unusual"**;

** =**3- ways to Measure Variations:**
*** **1- Range:**
**** **Max Value - Min value**
**** **easy to find**
**** **but bad thing is does not considers all values**
***[#pink] =**2- Standard deviation:** \n**standard** means average and\n**deviation** means (how far away it is or deviates)
****[#pink] **Definition:** measures the average distance, your average data values/points from the mean.
****[#pink] is **never negative**
****[#pink] is **never zero** unless one thing happens that is all data values/entries are the same
****[#pink] is **greatly affected** by the **outliers data or values**
*****[#gold] **Closely grouped data:** will have a **small** standard deviation value
*****[#gold] **Spread out data:** will have a **Large** standard deviation value
****[#pink] **__sample standard deviation__** is **denoted by 's'** \n<img:images/img_16.png> \nboth formula are correct any one of them can be used
****[#pink] **__Standard deviation for a population:__** \n<img:images/img_17.png>


***[#pink] **3- Variance:**
****[#pink] **Definition:** **Variance** is inherently based on the **standard deviation**, its the **number** you calculated just before taking the **square root**
****[#gold] **1- Sample Variance:** is **S** square \n<img:images/img_18.png>
****[#gold] **2- Population Variance:**\n<img:images/img_18.png>
