*[#red] =Lecture-6 Part-1: **The Multiplication Rule for "And" Probabilities**
** =we have transitioned from __descriptive statistics to inferential statistics__




* =//__Addition Rule for Probability__//\n<img:images/img_8.png> \n=<color #crimson>**//__In a single trial__//**
** =//Definition://
*** Probability of 'A' occurring or 'B' occurring or both A and B occurring <size:22>__in a single trial__

* =//Multiplication Rule for <color #lime>"And"</color> Probabilities// \n<img:images/img_16.png>
** =Definition:
*** =Probability of 'A' occurring<size:22>, and then </size>'B' occurring in <color #lime>__**successive trial**__
***:=P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)

*This is valid only when P(A)≠ 0 i.e. when event A is not an impossible event.
Similarly,

=P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

* This is valid only when P(B)≠ 0 i.e. when the event B is not an impossible event.

The below figure depicts the Venn diagram representation

**:=Example-1:
<img:images/img_17.png>
<img:images/img_18.png>;
***  =Example-2: \n<img:images/img_19.png> \nObserve one thing carefully the value of <size::22>**177** now has come down to **176**</size>\n this is the thing that separates the <size:22>"AND" and "AND Then"</size>

* =Conditional Probability
** =Definition:
*** The probability of an event occurring <size:18>__given that some other event has already occurred__\n<img:images/img_21.png>
*** Example-1 In case of guilty not guilty example some events did affect the other event
*** Example-2 In case of flipping a coin example one event did not affect the other event

* =Independent events
** The occurrence of one event <size:22>does not affect</size> the occurrence of another event (or subsequent events)\n=__Note:__ events that are not independent are __dependent events__\n<img:images/img_22.png>

** =Example\n<img:images/img_23.png>

*[#red] =Lecture-6 Part-2: **Probability of Complementary Events with "At Least One"**

* Sometimes it's easier to deal with the **complement of a set** than the **set** itself.

* ="At Least One" means One or more
** the complement of **"At Least One"** is <size:22> **"None"**


*:<img:images/img_25.png>
Why we do this because sometimes finding the probability of the
**complement** is very easier than finding <size:18> **P("At Least One")**;

** =Complementary events\n<img:images/img_13.png>
*** <img:images/img_14.png>
** =Example-1
***:flip the coin 3-times. What is the probability of getting "At Least One"" head?
= sample space:
<img:images/img_26.png>

<img:images/img_27.png>;

*** =Another way to solve it or look at this problem

****:<img:images/img_28.png>
<img:images/img_30.png>
Here the outcome of 2nd coin flip that is <size:22>**"T"**</size> does not depends on the
outcome of the first coin flip and so on. These are independent events
<img:images/img_31.png>;


* =Rare and Usual Probabilities
** =Rare
*** if you have <size:22>0 to 0.5  </size>value then this event is rare chance occurring
** =Usual
*** if you have <size:22>0.5 to 1.0 </size> value then this event is usual chance occurring

* =Conditional probability
**:The conditional probabilities if I flip them around are not necessarily the same they can be
different you are talking about two different scenarios if one thing happens before another
thing it can change that probability
