*[#red] =Lecture-6 Part-1: **The Multiplication Rule for "And" Probabilities**
** =we have transitioned from __descriptive statistics to inferential statistics__




* =//__Addition Rule for Probability__//\n<img:images/img_8.png> \n=<color #crimson>**//__In a single trial__//**
** =//Definition://
*** Probability of 'A' occurring or 'B' occurring or both A and B occurring <size:22>__in a single trial__

* =//Multiplication Rule for <color #lime>"And"</color> Probabilities// \n<img:images/img_16.png>
** =Definition:
*** =Probability of 'A' occurring<size:22>, and then </size>'B' occurring in <color #lime>__**successive trial**__
**:=Example-1:
<img:images/img_17.png>
<img:images/img_18.png>;
***  =Example-2: \n<img:images/img_19.png> \nObserve one thing carefully the value of <size::22>**177** now has come down to **176**</size>\n this is the thing that separates the <size:22>"AND" and "AND Then"</size>
