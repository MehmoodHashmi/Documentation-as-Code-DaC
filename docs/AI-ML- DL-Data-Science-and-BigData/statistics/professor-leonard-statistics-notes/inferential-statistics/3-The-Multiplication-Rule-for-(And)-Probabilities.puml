* =//__Addition Rule for Probability__//\n<img:images/img_8.png> \n=<color #crimson>**//__In a single trial__//**
** =//Definition://
*** Probability of 'A' occurring or 'B' occurring or both A and B occurring <size:22>__in a single trial__

* =//Multiplication Rule for <color #lime>"And"</color> Probabilities// \n<img:images/img_16.png>
** =Definition:
*** =Probability of 'A' occurring<size:22>, and then </size>'B' occurring in <color #lime>__**successive trial**__
***:=P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)

*This is valid only when P(A)≠ 0 i.e. when event A is not an impossible event.
Similarly,

=P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

* This is valid only when P(B)≠ 0 i.e. when the event B is not an impossible event.

***  =Example-2: \n<img:images/img_19.png> \nObserve one thing carefully the value of <size::22>**177** now has come down to **176**</size>\n this is the thing that separates the <size:22>"AND" and "AND Then"</size>

* =Conditional Probability
** =Definition:
*** The probability of an event occurring <size:18>__given that some other event has already occurred__\n<img:images/img_21.png>
*** Example-1 In case of guilty not guilty example some events did affect the other event
*** Example-2 In case of flipping a coin example one event did not affect the other event

* =Independent events
** The occurrence of one event <size:22>does not affect</size> the occurrence of another event (or subsequent events)\n=__Note:__ events that are not independent are __dependent events__\n<img:images/img_22.png>
