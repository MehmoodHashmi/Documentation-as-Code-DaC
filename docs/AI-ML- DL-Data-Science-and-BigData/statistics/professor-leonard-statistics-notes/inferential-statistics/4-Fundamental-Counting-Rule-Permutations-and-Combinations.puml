** =we have transitioned from __descriptive statistics to inferential statistics__

* =//__Counting__//
**:What we are doing in this type of **counting** is counting the ways that something can happen that's why this is called counting.
=Counting the ways in which __group of items__ can be __structured or reward.__ In how many ways if things can occur;

** =//__Fundamental Counting Rule __//\n<img:images/img_33.png>
*** If you have an event that can occur 'm' ways, and another event that can 'n' ways, that together they can count occur <size:22>m*n</size> ways.\n<img:images/img_34.png>

** =For any set of 'n' unique items, they can be arranged in the 'n' factorial different __ways (or arrangements).__
** ===These __different arrangements__ that we are talking about, every __different arrangement__ that is called <size:22>__a permutation.__

* =//__Permutation:__//
** **Definition:** A different arrangement of items\n'n' unique items <size:22>**====>**</size> **n!** unique permutations
***[#pink]:However, there are certain cases where in which you don't want to find out all the arrangements, you only need to select a few.

= __Rule for Permutations:__
# <size:22>'N'</size> different items
# <size:22>'r'</size> the number of items to be arranged out of <size:22>'N'</size> different items
# In permutation order (or arrangements) matters & very important
<img:images/img_37.png>
<size:22>**n!**</size> is total # of arrangements
<size:22>**(n-r)!**</size> is arrangements you don't care about;

***:==Permutation==
Let's consider a simple example of an **ordered permutation**.

    Suppose you have the set **{A, B, C}**, and you want to find an **ordered permutation** of this set.
    An **ordered permutation** means that the order in which the elements are arranged matters.

    There are **six possible ordered permutations** of this set:

    **1. ABC**
    **2. ACB**
    **3. BAC**
    **4. BCA**
    **5. CAB**
    **6. CBA**

    Each of these permutations represents a unique arrangement of the elements in the set.
    The order of the elements is crucial, so "ABC" is different from "CBA" because the order of the elements is reversed.
    These **ordered permutations** are often used in various mathematical and combinatorial problems.

==Combinatorics==
    In combinatorics, the order of elements often matters. The distinction between ordered and unordered arrangements is a
    fundamental concept in combinatorics.

    1. **Ordered Arrangements**: In ordered arrangements, the order in which the elements are arranged is crucial. For example,
    permutations are ordered arrangements where the order matters.
    In a permutation, rearranging the elements in a different sequence results in a distinct arrangement.

    2. **Unordered Arrangements**: In unordered arrangements, the order of the elements doesn't matter. These are often referred
    to as combinations. In a combination, different sequences of the same elements are considered equivalent, and only the selection
    of elements matters.

    So, whether order matters or not in combinatorial problems depends on the specific context and the type of arrangement
    you are dealing with.;



* =//__Addition Rule for Probability__//\n<img:images/img_8.png> \n=<color #crimson>**//__In a single trial__//**
** =//Definition://
*** Probability of 'A' occurring or 'B' occurring or both A and B occurring <size:22>__in a single trial__

* =//Multiplication Rule for <color #lime>"And"</color> Probabilities// \n<img:images/img_16.png>
** =Definition:
*** =Probability of 'A' occurring<size:22>, and then </size>'B' occurring in <color #lime>__**successive trial**__
***:=P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)

*This is valid only when P(A)≠ 0 i.e. when event A is not an impossible event.
Similarly,

=P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

* This is valid only when P(B)≠ 0 i.e. when the event B is not an impossible event.

The below figure depicts the Venn diagram representation

**:=Example-1:
<img:images/img_17.png>
<img:images/img_18.png>;
***  =Example-2: \n<img:images/img_19.png> \nObserve one thing carefully the value of <size::22>**177** now has come down to **176**</size>\n this is the thing that separates the <size:22>"AND" and "AND Then"</size>

* =Conditional Probability
** =Definition:
*** The probability of an event occurring <size:18>__given that some other event has already occurred__\n<img:images/img_21.png>
*** Example-1 In case of guilty not guilty example some events did affect the other event
*** Example-2 In case of flipping a coin example one event did not affect the other event

* =Independent events
** The occurrence of one event <size:22>does not affect</size> the occurrence of another event (or subsequent events)\n=__Note:__ events that are not independent are __dependent events__\n<img:images/img_22.png>

** =Example\n<img:images/img_23.png>

*[#red] =Lecture-6 Part-2: **Probability of Complementary Events with "At Least One"**

* Sometimes it's easier to deal with the **complement of a set** than the **set** itself.

* ="At Least One" means One or more
** the complement of **"At Least One"** is <size:22> **"None"**


*:<img:images/img_25.png>
Why we do this because sometimes finding the probability of the
**complement** is very easier than finding <size:18> **P("At Least One")**;

** =Complementary events\n<img:images/img_13.png>
*** <img:images/img_14.png>
** =Example-1
***:flip the coin 3-times. What is the probability of getting "At Least One"" head?
= sample space:
<img:images/img_26.png>

<img:images/img_27.png>;

*** =Another way to solve it or look at this problem

****:<img:images/img_28.png>
<img:images/img_30.png>
Here the outcome of 2nd coin flip that is <size:22>**"T"**</size> does not depends on the
outcome of the first coin flip and so on. These are independent events
<img:images/img_31.png>;


* =Rare and Usual Probabilities
** =Rare
*** if you have <size:22>0 to 0.5  </size>value then this event is rare chance occurring
** =Usual
*** if you have <size:22>0.5 to 1.0 </size> value then this event is usual chance occurring

* =Conditional probability
**:The conditional probabilities if I flip them around are not necessarily the same. They can be
different you are talking about two different scenarios if one thing happens before another
thing it can change that probability
