*[#red] =Lecture-1 Part-1: **The-Key-Words-and-Definitions-For-Elementary-Statistics**
* =**Data**
** =When we are talking about the __**data**__ in this class (statistics lectures) that means <color #green>**observations**</color>
** **Definition:** Any <size:22><color #green>**observations**</color> </size> that have been __collected__

* =**Statistics**
** =Collect data
***[#pink] You have to collect the data appropriately, so that your data is not **biased data**
***:*If you Collect data and do not know what to do with it, then it's **wasted time and useless data.**
*Why? because you don't know **how to  analyze, interpret and draw conclusions from data.**
*__Then collected data does not matter at all and data itself does not matter.__;

** =Analyze data
** =Interpret data
**[#red] =And draw conclusions from data

* =**Population**
** Complete set of all elements to be studied (OR being studied)
** **Is it necessary to study __each element__ of the <size:22>"set"? No**

*[#pink] =**Parameter and statistic**
** **Parameter:** Characteristic (trait) of a **Population**
** **Statistic:** Characteristic (trait) of a **Sample**
**:**Example:** These two **(parameter and statistic) could be talking about the same thing.** It just depends on what **group (population or sample)** you are referring.
E.g. if you find out that everybody's hair color in America is blond then it's **parameter**, everybody's hair color is blond. This will be characteristic of entire population.
__But if you take a **sample** from the **population** and then talk those **characteristics** then we refer them as **statistics**__;

* =**Sample**
** is generally smaller than **population** OR **sample** is some subset of the **population**
**[#pink] **Statistics** generally deals with the **samples**
***[#pink] **Population** is usually too big or huge for you to get any information in a timely manner
***[#pink] Your **sample** must be **random** so that it is not **biased data**. In other words, when you collect data make sure that you collect it randomly

* **Consensus**
** is collecting from **every member** of a **population**
**[#pink] **Statistics** generally deals with the **samples**
***[#pink] **Population** is usually too big or huge for you to get any information in a timely manner

*[#pink] =**Types of data**
**[#gold] ==**1. Qualitative Data (is <color #crimson>__categorical__</color>)**
*** **Definition:** Data that is **Non-Numeric**
*** **Examples:** Gender, Color, Race, Religion, Ethnicity, Army Rank, Zip Code (some **data** like **zip code** might have numbers in them but still they are **Quantitative**)
*** **Math operations** are **meaningless on Qualitative data** (or categorical data), you can't add, subtract, multiply, divide qualitative data
****[#red] =**Examples**
***** **Nominal data**
***** **Ordinal data**
**[#gold] ==**2. Quantitative Data**
*** =**Definition:** its //**__numerical__**// data
**** <img:images/img_32.png>
*** **Examples:** Height, weight, wages, MPH (miles per hour), Temperature, Time
*** **Math operations** are **meaningful on Quantitative data**, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide **quantitative data**
****[#red] =**Examples**
***** **Interval data**
***** **Ratio data**
***[#lime] ==**2-Types of Quantitative Data**
****[#crimson] ==1. Discrete Data
***** **Definition:** **Countable OR finite** (meaning there are only certain number of elements/values you can pick from)
***** **Example:** does a chicken lays half eggs, would you like to buy half watching machines, rolling a dice, etc.
***** Usually a **count**

****[#crimson] ==2. Continuous Data
***** **Definition:** **Infinite number of values or elements** (not countable)
***** **Example:** Temperature, Length, etc.
***** Usually a **__Measurement__**
****** Measurements are not easy, depends on tool used and how specific you want to be

* ===**4-Levels of Measurement**
** =//**What kind of "graph" to use for visualization is highly dependent on these 4-levels**//
***:=//Descriptive statistics://
is all about describing your data. To do this we firstly describe the spread of the data using the range and interquartile range.
Then we might look at the central tendency of the data using the mean, median and mode. We might also describe the variability using
the standard deviation and variance.
= And of course we want to visualise the data using graphs and plots. Selecting the right plot and graph might seem difficult
= but it is really quite easy when you think about the __two most important types of variables.__

= <color #crimson>**Categorical**</color> and <color #lime>**numeric**</color> variables.
* <size:18>A **__single categorical variable__** is usually represented with a **bar chart or bar plot.**
* <size:18>A **__single numerical variable__** is visualized with a **histogram or box plot (or boxplot).**
* <size:18>For **__two numerics__** we use a **scatter plot** and and so on.

This video will talk you through all of the combinations of variables, and how to create graphics that really talk to your audience.
If you're interested in data science and quantitative analysis, then this video is for you. If you are a beginner and want to learn
about statistics and how to work with data, then you'll love this video. This video is good for those learning data science but also
anyone wanting to learn about research methods for a masters degree of a PHD. Research methodology can be difficult but this
video will make it easy.

**[#white] =**1- Nominal Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** Can be **categorized** but **__not__ ordered**
*** **Example:** Religion, Race, etc.

**[#pink] =**2- Ordinal Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** Can be **__Ordered__**, but the **differences (subtraction)** are meaningless
**** Subtraction meaningless: Saying one is better than another does not make a lot  of sense
*** **Example:** Rank, <size:15>**Size (Short, Medium, Large, X-Large),**</size> Color (spectrum, you can order colors but can't subtract them because differences are meaningless )

**[#lime] =**3- interval Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** Can be **__Ordered__** and **differences (subtraction)** are meaningful, but there is no **__"Natural Zero"__**
****:**"Natural Zero:"** A natural zero means if you get a **__zero,__**
you have absolutely none of that quantity
(whatever that quantity is) you are talking about.;
****:**Example:** --Bank balance, Age,-- etc. But not
<color #lime>**Temperature**</color> (if your thermometer reads zero temperature
does that mean **extinction of temperature?** No, it means
something on the scale). So, <color #lime>**Temperature**</color>  does not have
**"Natural Zero"**;
*** **Example:** Such as **Temperature**, **temperature is interval data**. But not --Bank balance, Age,-- etc.

**[#gold] =**4- Ratio Level/Data**
*** **Definition:** just like **interval** but with a **__"Natural Zero"__**
****:**"Natural Zero:"** A natural zero means if you get a **__zero,__**
you have absolutely none of that quantity
(whatever that quantity is) you are talking about.;
****:**Example:** Bank balance, Age, etc. has **"Natural Zero"** But not
<color #lime>**Temperature**</color> (if your thermometer reads zero temperature
does that mean **extinction of temperature?** No, it means
something on the scale). So, <color #lime>**Temperature**</color>  does not have
**"Natural Zero"**;
*** **Example:** Bank balance, Age, etc.\n are **ratio data** But not --**temperature**--

*** Meaningful zero point
*** **Examples:** Height, Weight, Income, Time

* =Categories of Data and Learning
**:Unlabeled data typically falls under the category of "Unsupervised Learning" in the context of machine learning.
Unsupervised learning is a type of learning where the data does not have predefined labels or categories. The goal
is to explore the patterns, relationships, or structures within the data without any specific guidance.;
** Labeled Data
***[#pink] **Supervised Learning**
**** Classification
**** Regression
** Unlabeled Data
***[#pink] **Unsupervised Learning**
**** Clustering
**** Dimensionality Reduction
**** Anomaly Detection
**:This updated mindmap script reflects the distinction between labeled data used in supervised learning tasks and unlabeled data used
in unsupervised learning tasks. Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover patterns, groupings, or anomalies in the data without
relying on predefined labels.;

*:The distinction between labeled and unlabeled data is primarily used in the field of machine learning, where it plays a crucial role
 in the training and development of models. However, the concept of labeled and unlabeled data can also be relevant in other disciplines
  that involve data analysis and pattern recognition. Here are a few examples:

  **Data Mining:** Data mining is a field that focuses on discovering patterns, relationships, and insights from large datasets.
  In data mining, labeled data is often used for supervised learning tasks, while unlabeled data can be utilized for
  unsupervised learning tasks such as clustering or anomaly detection.

  **Statistics:** In statistics, labeled data is commonly used for statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
   **__Unlabeled data__,** on the other hand, can be explored using techniques like **exploratory data analysis or clustering** to gain insights
    into the underlying structure of the data.

  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** In NLP, labeled data is often required for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition,
   or text classification. Unlabeled data can be utilized for tasks such as topic modeling or word embeddings, where the goal is to uncover
    latent patterns or representations in text.

  While the terminology may vary across disciplines, the fundamental idea of distinguishing between labeled and unlabeled data remains
  applicable in various fields that involve data analysis, modeling, and pattern recognition.;

*[#red] Lecture-1 Part-3: **Sampling Techniques: How to Develop a __random Sample__**

* =**Observation vs Experiment**
** Definition
*** **Observation:** Collecting data by observing natural phenomena without manipulating any variables.
*** **another Observation definition:** Measure specific traits but does not modify the subject.
*** **Experiment:** A systematic and controlled procedure performed to test a hypothesis by manipulating variables and collecting data.
*** **another Experiment definition:** Apply **treatment** and then measure the effect on the **subject.**

* =**Random**
** **Definition:** **each member** of a **population** has an equal chance of being selected in a **sample**

* =**Simple Random Sample**
** **Definition:** **each group** of a **size 'm'** has an equal chance of being selected in a **sample**

* ==**4-Common Sampling Techniques**
**[#pink] **Convenience Sample:** use the results that are easy to get (Not Random), so therefore its never used in conducting real observations or experiments
**[#lime] **Systematic Sample:** put a population in order and select every "K" member
**[#orange] **__Strata__fied Sample:** "Strata means layers", breaks the population into subgroups based on a characteristic, then sample **__each__** group
**[#crimson] **__Cluster__ Sample:** divide population into **"groups or clusters"** (regardless of the characteristic), randomly select a certain number "groups or clusters", and then collect data from the **__entire__** cluster

* **2-Types of Sampling errors that can occur while you are sampling**
** **Non Sampling Error:** when you write down wrong information or make a math error something like this, it's called non-sampling error.
** **Sampling Error:** is the difference in characteristics between your sample and your population, because usually a sample does not **represents 100%** a population \nperfectly there will always a margin of error, and this difference (of margin error) is called sampling error
