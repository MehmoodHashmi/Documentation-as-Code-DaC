* Data Vault vs 3NF vs Dimensional Modeling
** Data Vault
*** Overview
**** Data Vault is a data modeling methodology designed for data warehousing and analytics.
**** It focuses on scalability, flexibility, auditability, and historical tracking of data.
*** Key Concepts
**** Hub
***** Represents a business key or a unique identifier for an entity.
**** Link
***** Represents a many-to-many relationship between Hubs.
**** Satellite
***** Contains descriptive or contextual information about Hubs and Links.
**** Vault
***** Collection of interconnected Hubs, Links, and Satellites.
*** Benefits
**** Scalability
***** Supports incremental data loading and parallel processing.
**** Flexibility
***** Adaptable to changes in business requirements.
**** Auditability
***** Tracks historical changes and provides traceability of data.
*** Challenges
**** Complexity
***** Requires additional effort in data modeling and development.
**** Performance
***** May impact query performance due to schema complexity.
** 3NF (Third Normal Form)
*** Overview
**** 3NF is a data normalization technique that reduces data redundancy and ensures data integrity.
**** It focuses on eliminating data anomalies and maintaining data consistency.
*** Key Concepts
**** Entity
***** Represents a distinct real-world object or concept.
**** Attributes
***** Descriptive properties of an entity.
**** Relationships
***** Associations between entities.
*** Benefits
**** Data Integrity
***** Reduces data redundancy and ensures consistent data.
**** Relational Integrity
***** Supports complex relationships between entities.
**** Data Consistency
***** Helps maintain data quality and accuracy.
*** Challenges
**** Performance
***** May require complex joins and queries for data retrieval.
**** Data Redundancy
***** Can result in larger data storage requirements.
** Dimensional Modeling
*** Overview
**** Dimensional Modeling is a data modeling technique for data warehousing and business intelligence.
**** It focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and query performance.
*** Key Concepts
**** Fact Table
***** Contains the numerical and measurable data (facts) related to a business process.
**** Dimension Table
***** Contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts in the Fact Table.
**** Star Schema
***** Consists of a central Fact Table connected to multiple Dimension Tables.
*** Benefits
**** Query Performance
***** Optimized for analytical queries and aggregations.
**** Simplicity
***** Easy to understand and navigate for business users.
**** Performance
***** Efficient for reporting and ad-hoc analysis.
*** Challenges
**** Data Redundancy
***** Can result in duplicated data in Dimension Tables.
**** Limited Flexibility
***** Less adaptable to changes in business requirements.
