*:Biotechnology (biotech) and genetic engineering are related fields, but they have distinct differences:

  1. **Scope**:
     - **Biotechnology**: Biotechnology is a broad field that involves using living organisms, or their systems, to develop or create products, processes, and technologies that can benefit
      various industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and environmental science. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and applications.
     - **Genetic Engineering**: Genetic engineering is a specific subset of biotechnology. It primarily focuses on manipulating the genetic material (DNA) of organisms, typically to add,
     delete, or modify specific genes. Genetic engineering often involves the direct alteration of an organism's genetic code.

  2. **Methods**:
     - **Biotechnology**: Biotechnology encompasses a variety of techniques, including fermentation, tissue culture, and bioprocessing, among others. It can involve the use of biological
     systems for various purposes, such as the production of antibiotics or the development of new crop varieties.
     - **Genetic Engineering**: Genetic engineering primarily involves the direct manipulation of genes. This can be done using techniques like recombinant DNA technology, CRISPR-Cas9, or
      gene splicing, where specific genes are altered or transferred between organisms.

  3. **Applications**:
     - **Biotechnology**: Biotechnology has a wide range of applications, including the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and genetically modified crops, as well as in medical
     diagnostics and environmental cleanup.
     - **Genetic Engineering**: Genetic engineering is often associated with applications like creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs), gene therapy for medical conditions, and
      engineering bacteria to produce specific proteins.

  4. **Scale**:
     - **Biotechnology**: Biotechnology applications can range from large-scale industrial processes to small-scale laboratory experiments. It can encompass a wide range of activities
     at various scales.
     - **Genetic Engineering**: Genetic engineering is often more focused on specific genetic modifications and tends to be at a smaller scale, such as modifying the genes of a single
     organism or cell.

  5. **Regulation**:
     - **Biotechnology**: Regulations for biotechnology can be complex and vary by country and application. They often focus on ensuring the safety of products and processes developed
      using biotechnology.
     - **Genetic Engineering**: Genetic engineering is subject to specific regulations related to the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment and the use of
     genetic engineering in healthcare.

  In summary, biotechnology is a broader field that encompasses various applications involving living organisms, while genetic engineering is a specific subset of biotechnology that
  focuses on the direct manipulation of genes within those organisms. Genetic engineering is one of the techniques used within the field of biotechnology to achieve specific goals,
  such as creating GMOs or treating genetic disorders.;
