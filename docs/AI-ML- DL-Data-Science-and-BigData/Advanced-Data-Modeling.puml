* Advanced Data Modeling
** Definition: Advanced techniques and concepts used to model complex data scenarios and address specific requirements in data management and analysis.
** Hierarchical Data Model
*** Definition: Represents data in a hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships, similar to a tree-like structure.
*** Examples: XML, LDAP.
** Network Data Model
*** Definition: Extends the hierarchical model by allowing many-to-many relationships between records, enabling more complex data relationships.
*** Examples: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
** Object-Oriented Data Model
*** Definition: Represents data as objects with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods), allowing for encapsulation and inheritance.
*** Examples: Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS).
** Semantic Data Model
*** Definition: Focuses on the meaning and interpretation of data, representing the semantics and relationships between data elements.
*** Examples: Resource Description Framework (RDF), Ontology.
** NoSQL Data Model
*** Definition: Provides flexible and scalable data models that depart from traditional relational databases, enabling storage and retrieval of unstructured and semi-structured data.
*** Examples: Key-Value, Document, Columnar, Graph databases.
** Data Vault Modeling
*** Definition: A modeling technique for building data warehouses that emphasizes scalability, flexibility, and auditability, with a focus on historical tracking and data integration.
*** Examples: Data Vault 2.0.
** Multi-Dimensional Modeling
*** Definition: Models data for online analytical processing (OLAP) applications, focusing on dimensions (descriptive attributes) and facts (measurable data).
*** Examples: Multi-Dimensional Expressions (MDX), Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cubes.
** Data Modeling Tools
*** Definition: Software tools that support the creation, visualization, and management of data models, providing features for designing, documenting, and analyzing data structures.
*** Examples: ER/Studio, PowerDesigner, Lucidchart.
** Data Modeling Best Practices
*** Definition: Guidelines and principles to follow when designing and implementing data models to ensure consistency, maintainability, and performance.
*** Examples: Naming conventions, standardization, data modeling patterns.
