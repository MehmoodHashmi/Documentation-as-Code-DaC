* DAG Data Pipeline
** Definition
*** A data processing pipeline that uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as its underlying structure
** Components
*** Source: Provides the initial data to be processed
*** Transformation: Applies operations and transformations on the data
*** Sink: Stores or outputs the processed data
** Characteristics
*** Task-based: Each node in the DAG represents a specific task or operation
*** Dependency-driven: Edges define the data flow and dependencies between tasks
*** Parallel execution: Independent tasks can be executed concurrently
*** Fault-tolerant: Supports error handling and retries for task failures
** Advantages
*** Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally
*** Flexibility: Supports different types of data sources, transformations, and sinks
*** Modularity: Tasks can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the entire pipeline
*** Reusability: Common tasks or transformations can be shared across multiple pipelines
** Use Cases
*** Data ingestion and extraction
*** Data transformation and cleansing
*** Data aggregation and analytics
*** Real-time streaming processing
** Tools and Frameworks
*** Apache Airflow
*** Apache NiFi
*** Apache Beam
*** Luigi
*** AWS Data Pipeline
** Best Practices
*** Design a clear and well-defined DAG structure
*** Identify and handle data dependencies between tasks
*** Optimize task execution order for performance
*** Monitor and log task progress and data flow
*** Implement error handling and retries for fault tolerance
