* Neural Network Architecture
** Basics of Neural Networks
*** Neurons and Activation Functions - Neurons simulate the functioning of biological neurons, and activation functions determine the output of a neuron.
*** Weights and Biases - Weights control the strength of connections, and biases introduce a shift in neuron behavior.
*** Layers **(Input, Hidden, Output)** - Neural networks are organized into **layers (input, hidden, and output).**
*** Feedforward and Backpropagation - Feedforward processes data through the network, while backpropagation adjusts weights during training.

** Types of Neural Networks
***[#yellow] Feedforward Neural Networks **(FNN)** - Standard neural networks where information flows in one direction.
***[#yellow] Convolutional Neural Networks **(CNN)** - Specialized for image processing, using convolutional layers.
***[#yellow] Recurrent Neural Networks **(RNN)** - Suitable for sequential data, with recurrent connections.
***[#yellow] Long Short-Term Memory **(LSTM)** - A type of RNN with improved memory capabilities.
***[#yellow] Gated Recurrent Units **(GRU)** - A simpler RNN variant with gating mechanisms.

** Layer Types
*** Input Layer - Receives input data and passes it to the hidden layers.
*** Hidden Layers - Process information via various types, such as fully connected, convolutional, or recurrent.
*** Output Layer - Produces the final network output.

** Activation Functions
*** Sigmoid - S-shaped curve used in earlier neural networks.
*** Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) - Similar to the sigmoid but with output in the range [-1, 1].
*** Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) - Widely used activation function with a linear segment.
*** Leaky ReLU (LReLU) - Variation of ReLU with a small slope for negative values.
