title =Deep Learning Frameworks and Libraries

* Deep Learning
** **Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning that deals with neural networks and complex data representations.

** =Frameworks
*** **Deep learning frameworks** provide the foundation for building and training neural networks.

***[#lime] ===TensorFlow
**** Developed by Google Brain.
**** Widely used for research and production.
**** Supports deep learning and machine learning.

*** PyTorch
**** Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).
**** Known for its dynamic computation graph.
**** Popular among researchers and academics.

***[#yellow] ===Keras
**** High-level neural networks API.
**** Can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.
**** User-friendly for rapid prototyping.

*** Caffe
**** Developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC).
**** Efficient for image classification and convolutional networks.

*** MXNet
**** Apache project for deep learning.
**** Known for its scalability and efficiency.

** =Libraries
*** Deep learning libraries offer pre-built tools and utilities for various deep learning tasks.

*** Scikit-Learn
**** General-purpose machine learning library.
**** Includes deep learning tools via Keras integration.

*** Theano
**** Open-source numerical computation library.
**** Was used for deep learning but has been largely replaced by newer frameworks.

*** CNTK **(Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit)**
**** Developed by Microsoft for deep learning.
**** Efficient for image and speech recognition.

*** DL4J **(Deeplearning4j)**
**** Java-based deep learning library.
**** Suitable for enterprise applications.

** Common Themes
*** Both frameworks and libraries play crucial roles in deep learning development.
*** Frameworks provide a comprehensive platform for building custom neural networks.
*** Libraries offer pre-built solutions for specific tasks and integration with frameworks.
