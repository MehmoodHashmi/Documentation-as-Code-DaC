* Deep Learning
** ====<size:16>Deep learning
*** ====<size:16>is a "subset" of "machine learning" that deals with "neural networks" and "complex data representations".

**[#orange] =Frameworks
*** ====<size:16>**Deep learning frameworks** provide the foundation for "building and training neural networks."

***[#lime] ===TensorFlow
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Developed by **"Google"** Brain.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Widely used for research and production.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Supports deep learning and machine learning.

***[#gold] ====**PyTorch**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Developed by **"Facebook's"** AI Research lab **(FAIR).**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Known for its dynamic computation graph.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Popular among researchers and academics.

***[#pink] ===Keras
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>High-level neural networks API.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>User-friendly for rapid prototyping.

*** Caffe
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center **(BVLC).**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Efficient for image classification and convolutional networks.

*** MXNet
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Apache project for deep learning.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Known for its scalability and efficiency.

**[#white] =Libraries
*** ====<size:16>**Deep learning libraries** offer pre-built tools and utilities for various deep learning tasks.

*** Scikit-Learn
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>General-purpose machine learning library.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Includes deep learning tools via Keras integration.

*** Theano
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Open-source numerical computation library.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Was used for deep learning but has been largely replaced by newer frameworks.

*** CNTK **(Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Developed by **Microsoft** for deep learning.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Efficient for image and speech recognition.

*** DL4J **(Deeplearning4j)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Java-based deep learning library.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Suitable for enterprise applications.

** Common Themes
*** Both frameworks and libraries play crucial roles in deep learning development.
