* Data Modeling
**[#a] **Definition:** The process of creating a conceptual, logical, and physical representation of data structures and relationships within an organization's database system.
** Types of Data Models
*** Conceptual Data Model
****[#a] **Definition:** Represents high-level business concepts and relationships without specific implementation details.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Entity-Relationship (ER) model, Object-Oriented model.
*** Logical Data Model
****[#a] **Definition:** Defines the structure, relationships, and constraints of data at a more detailed level, independent of any specific database management system.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Relational model (tables, entities, attributes), Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram.
*** Physical Data Model
****[#a] **Definition:** Specifies the implementation details of data structures, including storage formats, indexing, and optimization considerations.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Relational schema,[#a] Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts.
** Data Modeling Approaches
*** Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling
****[#a] **Definition:** Represents entities, attributes, and relationships between entities using entity-relationship diagrams.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Crow's Foot notation, Chen notation.
***[#pink] ===Dimensional Modeling
****[#a] **Definition:** Focuses on modeling data for data warehousing and business intelligence applications, emphasizing the relationships between dimensions and facts.
****[#gold] ****Examples:** Star schema, Snowflake schema.**
*** Object-Relational Modeling
****[#a] **Definition:** Combines object-oriented concepts with relational database principles, allowing for the storage of complex data types and behavior.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Object-Relational Database Management Systems (ORDBMS), Unified Modeling Language (UML) extensions.
** Key Concepts in Data Modeling
*** Entities
****[#a] **Definition:** Represent real-world objects, such as customers, products, or orders, with attributes that describe their properties.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Customer entity (name, address, email), Product entity (name, price, description).
*** Relationships
****[#a] **Definition:** Capture associations and interactions between entities, defining how they are related to each other.
****[#gold] **Examples:** One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.
*** Attributes
****[#a] **Definition:** Describe the characteristics or properties of entities.
****[#gold] **Examples:** Name, Age, Address.
*** Primary Key
****[#a] **Definition:** Uniquely identifies each record in an entity, ensuring its uniqueness and integrity.
****[#gold] **Examples:** CustomerID, ProductCode.
*** Foreign Key
****[#a] **Definition:** Links an attribute in one entity to the primary key of another entity, establishing relationships between entities.
****[#gold] **Examples:** CustomerID in Order entity referencing Customer entity.
*** Normalization
****[#a] **Definition:** The process of organizing data into logical and efficient structures to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.
****[#gold] **Examples:** First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF).
