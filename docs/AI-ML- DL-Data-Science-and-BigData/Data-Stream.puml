title =__ Data Stream__
* Data Stream

** Definition
*** Continuous flow of data records or events
*** Represents the movement of data from a source to a destination

**[#pink] Characteristics
*** Continuity
**** Data stream is continuous and can be infinite in length
**** New data records are continuously added to the stream over time

*** Ordering
**** Data records in a stream may have a specific order or timestamp
**** Processing often depends on preserving the order of records

*** Volume
**** Data streams can contain a large volume of data
**** Handling large volumes may require scalable processing systems

*** Velocity
**** Data streams are processed in real-time or near real-time
**** Processing speed and low latency are important for stream processing

**[#pink] **Use Cases**
*** Real-Time Analytics
**** Stream processing enables immediate analysis and insights from data
**** Examples: Fraud detection, stock market analysis, IoT data analysis

*** Event Sourcing and CQRS
**** Data streams can be used to capture and replay events for system state management
**** Examples: Event-driven architectures, event sourcing patterns

*** Data Integration and ETL
**** Streaming data allows continuous ingestion and transformation of data
**** Examples: Data pipelines, data lakes, real-time data synchronization

**[#pink] **Technologies**
***[#pink] **Apache Kafka**
**** Distributed streaming platform for handling high-volume, fault-tolerant data streams

*** Apache Flink
**** Stream processing framework for distributed, fault-tolerant, and event-driven applications

*** Amazon Kinesis
**** Managed streaming service for ingesting, processing, and analyzing data streams

*** Apache NiFi
**** Data integration platform that supports real-time data streaming and processing

***[#pink] **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**
**** Messaging and event ingestion service for real-time data streaming
