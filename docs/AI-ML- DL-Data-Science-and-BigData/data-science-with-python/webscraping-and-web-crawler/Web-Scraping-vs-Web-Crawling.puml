title =__ Web Scraping vs Web Crawling__

*:Web crawling and web scraping are two distinct processes often used together to collect data from websites. While they share similarities, there are important differences between them.

  **Web Crawling:**
  **- Process: **Systematically visits websites and downloads their content using web crawlers (spiders or bots).
  **- Purpose: **Find and download web pages, including HTML code, images, and other files.
  **- Tools: **Web crawlers (spiders, bots).
  **- Use cases:** Search engines, website indexing, data analysis, and aggregation.
  **- Legality:** <color #lime>**Generally legal as long as it adheres to website policies and respects robots.txt.**</color>

  **Web Scraping:**
  **- Process: **Extracts specific data from web pages using web scrapers (harvesters or spiders).
  **- Purpose: **Extract targeted data from web pages by leveraging the downloaded HTML code.
  **- Tools: **Web scrapers (harvesters, spiders).
  **- Use cases**: Data mining, market research, competitive analysis, lead generation.
  **- Legality: **<color #green>**Legality depends on website permissions and adherence to terms of service.**</color>

  It's important to note that web scraping may be considered illegal if performed without explicit permission from
  the website owner. Always review and comply with the terms of service and robots.txt of the websites you intend to scrape.

  **Summary:**
  Web crawling is focused on discovering and downloading web pages, while web scraping is centered around extracting
  specific data from those web pages. Both processes have their own purposes, tools, use cases, and legal considerations.;
