* ggplot2 Library
** **Core Concepts**
*** **Data Layers:** Represents different types of data visualizations that can be added to a plot.
**** **Geom Point:** Displays data points as individual points.
**** **Geom Line:** Connects data points with lines.
**** **Geom Bar:** Represents data using vertical or horizontal bars.
**** **Geom Area:** Fills the area between a line and a baseline.
**** **Geom Boxplot:** Displays statistical summaries of a dataset.
**** **Geom Histogram:** Shows the distribution of a continuous variable.
**** **Geom Density:** Estimates and plots a smoothed density curve.

*** **Aesthetics:** Define how data variables are mapped to visual properties of the plot.
**** **x:** Specifies the variable to be displayed on the x-axis.
**** **y:** Specifies the variable to be displayed on the y-axis.
**** **color:** Maps a variable to color.
**** **fill:** Fills a shape or area with color.
**** **size:** Changes the size of a shape.
**** **shape:** Modifies the shape of a point.
**** **alpha:** Adjusts the transparency of elements.
**** **linetype:** Controls the line style.

*** **Geometries:** Determine the visual representation of the data.
**** **Point:** Represents data as individual points.
**** **Line:** Connects data points with lines.
**** **Bar:** Displays data using vertical or horizontal bars.
**** **Area:** Fills the area between a line and a baseline.
**** **Boxplot:** Visualizes statistical summaries of a dataset.
**** **Histogram:** Displays the distribution of a continuous variable.
**** **Density:** Estimates and plots a smoothed density curve.

*** **Scales:** Control how data values are mapped to visual properties.
**** **Continuous Scale:** Maps continuous data to a continuous range of values.
**** **Discrete Scale:** Maps discrete data to a discrete set of values.
**** **Color Scale:** Assigns colors to data values.
**** **Fill Scale:** Determines the fill color of shapes or areas.
**** **Size Scale:** Adjusts the size of shapes.
**** **Shape Scale:** Modifies the shape of points.
**** **Alpha Scale:** Controls the transparency of elements.
**** **Linetype Scale:** Changes the line style.

*** **Facets:** Divides the data into subsets based on one or more variables and creates multiple plots.
**** **Facet Wrap:** Creates a grid of plots with one variable defining the rows and another defining the columns.
**** **Facet Grid:** Generates a grid of plots with separate panels for each combination of variables.

*** **Themes:** Customize the appearance and style of the plot.
**** **Theme_bw:** Applies a black and white theme to the plot.
**** **Theme_classic:** Applies a classic theme with gray backgrounds and no gridlines.
**** **Theme_minimal:** Provides a minimalistic theme with no background and thin lines.
**** **Theme_void:** Removes all backgrounds, gridlines, and axes.

** Additional Features
*** **Legends:** Display information about the mapping of data variables to plot aesthetics.
*** **Labels:** Add text labels to the plot to provide additional information.
*** **Titles:** Specify titles for the plot and axes.
*** **Annotations:** Add text or graphical annotations to highlight specific data points or regions.
*** **Statistical Transformations:** Perform statistical calculations on the data before plotting.
*** **Customization with Layers:** Combine multiple plot elements and customize their appearance.
