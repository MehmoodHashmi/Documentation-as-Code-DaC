title =__ Matplotlib __

* **Definition**
** =+ Matplotlib
*** - Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
*** - Provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting and charting
*** - Offers a wide range of plot types and customization options
*** - Supports 2D and 3D visualizations

* **Key Concepts**
** =+ Figure
*** - The top-level container that holds all elements of a plot
*** - Represents the entire image or window where the plot is rendered
** =+ Axes
*** - The region inside a Figure where data is plotted
*** - Contains the actual plotting area, tick marks, labels, and gridlines
** =+ Plots
*** - Visual representations of data (e.g., line plots, bar plots, scatter plots)
*** - Created within an Axes object using plotting functions
** =+ Artists
*** - Objects that represent individual graphical elements (e.g., lines, markers, text)
*** - Can be modified to customize the appearance of the plot
** =+ Ticks and Labels
*** - Represent the values and labels along the axes
*** - Can be customized to control the appearance and formatting
** =+ Legends
*** - Provide a key to identify different elements in the plot
*** - Can be added to the plot to enhance readability
** =+ Annotations
*** - Text or arrows added to the plot to provide additional information
*** - Used for labeling specific points or regions of interest
** =+ Styles and Colormaps
*** - Control the visual appearance of the plot, such as colors and line styles
*** - Matplotlib provides a variety of predefined styles and colormaps
** =+ Subplots
*** - Multiple plots arranged in a grid within a Figure
*** - Enable the creation of complex layouts and comparisons

* **Plot Types**
** =+ Line Plots
