* **Definition**
** =+ Seaborn
***[#pink] **- Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib**
*** - Provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics
*** - Designed to work well with Pandas data frames
*** - Offers a variety of built-in themes and color palettes

* **Key Concepts**
** =+ Figure Aesthetics
*** - Built-in themes that control the overall appearance of the plots
*** - Themes include options like darkgrid, whitegrid, dark, white, and more
** =+ Color Palettes
*** - Predefined color schemes that can be applied to plots
*** - Seaborn provides a wide range of color palettes to choose from
**[#pink] **=+ Plot Types**
*** - Seaborn supports various statistical plots, including:
****[#pink] **- Distribution plots** (e.g., histograms, kernel density estimation)
****[#pink] **- Categorical plots** (e.g., bar plots, count plots)
****[#pink] **- Relational plots** (e.g., scatter plots, line plots)
****[#pink] **- Regression plots** (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression)
****[#pink] **- Matrix plots** (e.g., heatmaps, cluster maps)
****[#pink] **- Time series plots** (e.g., line plots, point plots)
** =+ Plot Customization
*** - Seaborn provides options for customizing the appearance of plots, such as:
**** - Changing plot colors and styles
**** - Modifying axis labels and ticks
**** - Adding annotations and text to the plot
**** - Adjusting plot size and aspect ratio
**** - Controlling plot grids and spines

* **Built-in Plots**
** =+ Histograms
** =+ Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots
** =+ Bar Plots
** =+ Count Plots
** =+ Box Plots
** =+ Violin Plots
** =+ Scatter Plots
** =+ Line Plots
** =+ Regression Plots
** =+ Heatmaps
** =+ Cluster Maps
** =+ Pair Plots
** =+ Facet Grids

* **Statistical Functionality**
** =+ Aggregation and Summarization
*** - Seaborn provides functions to compute summary statistics of datasets
*** - Functions like mean, median, percentiles, and more can be used with plots
** =+ Grouping and Categorization
*** - Seaborn allows grouping data based on categorical variables
*** - Functions like bar plots, count plots, and box plots can be grouped by categories
** =+ Statistical Tests
*** - Seaborn integrates with other libraries to perform statistical tests on data
*** - Functions like t-tests, ANOVA, correlation tests, and more are available
