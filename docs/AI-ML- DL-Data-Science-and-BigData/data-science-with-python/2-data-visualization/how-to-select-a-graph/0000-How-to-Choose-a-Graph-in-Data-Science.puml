* =//__How to Choose a Graph in Data Science__//
** =Purpose
*** Determine the purpose of the graph:
**** Visualizing trends
**** Comparing data
**** Showing relationships
**** Exploring patterns
**** Presenting insights

** =Data Type and Structure
*** Identify the type and structure of your data:
**** Categorical data
**** Numerical data
**** Time-series data
**** Textual data
**** Network data

** =Relationship to Explore
*** Determine the relationship or pattern you want to highlight:
**** Comparison
****[#red] =Correlation
**** Distribution
**** Composition
****[#lime] =Proportion
**** Ranking
**** Flow

** =Graph Types
*** Bar chart
*** Line chart
*** Scatter plot
*** Pie chart
*** Area chart
*** Histogram
*** Box plot
*** Network graph
*** Heat map
*** Sankey diagram
*** Radar chart
*** Choropleth map

**[#pink] =**Data Distribution and Characteristics**
*** Consider the distribution and characteristics\nof your data:
**** Symmetric or skewed distribution
**** Outliers
**** Missing values
**** Seasonality or periodicity
**** Clusters or groups

** =Audience and Context
*** Consider the audience and the context in which the graph will be presented:
**** Executive summary
**** Technical report
**** Presentation to non-technical stakeholders

** =Visual Encoding
*** Choose appropriate visual encodings for your data:
**** Position
**** Length
**** Angle
**** Area
**** Color
**** Shape
**** Texture
**** Opacity

**[#pink] =Storytelling and Narrative
*** Craft a clear and concise narrative to guide the viewer through the graph and communicate key insights effectively.

** Tools and Libraries
*** Explore different tools and libraries available for graphing in data science:
**** Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)
**** R packages (ggplot2, lattice, visNetwork)
**** Business intelligence tools (Tableau, Power BI)
**** Visualization frameworks (D3.js, Vega-Lite)

** =Iteration and Evaluation
*** Iterate and evaluate different graph types and configurations to choose the most \nappropriate representation for your data and analysis goals.

** =Best Practices and Guidelines
*** Follow best practices and guidelines for effective data visualization, such as simplifying visuals,\n providing clear labels and titles, using appropriate color schemes, and avoiding chartjunk.
