== Introduction

This is the security point of view. It describes all the measures implemented to prevent unauthorized use, misuse, illegitimate modification or misappropriation of application modules.

The other views of the document are accessible link:./README.adoc[from here].

The project glossary is available link:glossary.adoc[here]. We will not redefine the functional or technical terms used here.

[TIP]
Availability is dealt with in the infrastructure section. Even if availability concept is often handled with Integrity and Confidentiality (the "CIA triad"), this model is role-oriented and we feel that availability is more often managed by infrastructure architects than by the security experts.

== Constraints

[TIP]
====
List here the constraints relating to security, this includes for example but not only:

* Isolation of components within network areas (DMZ, firewalls, reverse-proxy, etc.)
* Applicable standards (such as password policies)
* Legal constraints (GDPR for example)

====
====
Example 1: the password policy will have to conform to the xyz standard.
====
====
Example 2: a component in the internet zone is formally prohibited from accessing the intranet zone.
====
====
Example 3: in application of the GDPR, user data must be encrypted.
====

== Requirements

[TIP]
====
Present the requirements here, *not the measures meeting them*. These will be detailed in chapter 3.

For particularly sensitive projects, provide a risk analysis file. To do this, for example, use the https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/la-methode-ebios-risk-manager-le-guide/[EBIOS Risk Manager] framework.
====

[[integrity-requirements]]
=== Integrity requirements

[TIP]
====
Integrity is about the durability, accuracy, and level of confidence in application data.

Managing data integrity consists in verifying that it cannot be altered or deleted (involuntarily, following a disk crash for example) or voluntarily, for example in the context of a "man in the middle" attack or by a person who has granted himself undue rights.

Be careful not to multiply the data classes. It is possible to define only one data class for the entire application.

[[identification-requirements]]
=== Identification requirements

[TIP]
====
Identification is the set of measures used to differentiate one user from another (but without verifying that he is who he claims to be).
====

====
Example 1: a user can only have one username and a username cannot be shared by multiple users. The personal e-mail address is therefore a good identifier.
====
====
Example 2: the identity of an Internet user will be checked before any API call.
====
====
Example 3: an ID cannot be deleted, cannot be modified and cannot be reused.
====

[[authentication-requirements]]
=== Authentication requirements

[TIP]
====
Authentication makes it possible to verify the consistency between the identity of a user and a real person.

Note that automatic non-human interactions (such as batches calling an API) can also be identified and authenticated (batch which uses an access-token to call a service for example).

Authentication can be one or more factors (in the latter case, we speak of strong authentication). These factors can be:

* Something that we *know* (typically a password).
* Something that we *are* (biometrics).
* Something we *own* (token, unique password generator, ID document ...).

Remember to describe the authentication system once registered but also during registration (i.e., the initial authentication).

A possible delegation of authentication relies on identity federation technology to authenticate the user.

It is possible to add authentication factors specific to your organization to the table below as needed.
====

It is possible to require several occurrences of the same factor, use as many crosses:

[[identity-federation-requirements]]
=== Identity Federation Requirements

[TIP]
====
Identity federation is the use of the same identity managed by an identity provider (IdP) from several different entities.

For example, see the “Connect with[Google | Twitter | ...]” OpenId Connect technology. Unlike SSO, identity federation does not provide automatic login to an application such as SSO but simply allows you to reuse the same credentials (login/password).
====

====
Example: Identification and authentication will be outsourced to the Auth0 identity provider to simplify security management and reduce development and operating costs.
====

[[sso-requirements]]
=== SSO and SLO requirements

[TIP]
====
Describe the needs in terms of Single Sign On and Single Log Out.

Here we mean SSO in its fullest sense: automatic authentication to an application of a user already authenticated from another application in the same trusted domain.

Please note that setting up SSO can be complex, especially if the infrastructure (ID provider, etc.) does not yet exist and often requires adaptation of applications.

The SSO can be requested by the end-users but this requirement must be justified. An infrequently used peripheral application or tool usually does not need SSO (a simple centralized authentication is often sufficient).

Also, be careful to assess the impact that weak authentication (bad password for example) would have on the security of the entire IS.
====
====
Example 1: No SSO is required since all application GUIs are exposed within a JSR 352 portal which already manages authentication.
====
====
Example 2: no need for SSO or SLO is identified
====
====
Example 3: this Web application must provide single authentication shared with that of other intranet applications. Once authenticated on one of the applications, the agent must not have to reconnect (until his session expires). Likewise, a disconnection from one of the applications must ensure the disconnection of all intranet applications.
====

[[non-repudiation-requirements]]
=== Non-repudiation requirements

[TIP]
====
List here the business actions with a non-repudiation requirement, i.e., a measure making it impossible to deny a contract by proving the identity of the two parties and the integrity of the document by digital signature.
====

|===

[[privacy-requirements]]
=== Anonymity and privacy requirements

[TIP]
List the constraints of anonymity and legal privacy.

====
Example 1: No data consolidation should be possible between data in the PERSON domain and in the HEALTH domain.
====
====
Example 2: For the sake of confidentiality in the event of a computer intrusion, some personal data will be redacted before replication into the public area: cholesterol level and weight.
====
====
Example 3: No racial, political, union, religious or sexual orientation data can be stored in any form whatsoever in the IS.
====
====
Example 4: The OpenData data from the “housing” domain will only contain consolidated data at the common level, not more precise.
====
====
Example 5: In application of a European directive, a banner must inform the user of the presence of cookies.
====
====
Example 6: Pursuant to the GDPR, explicit consent from users to store their personal health data will be offered.
====

[[authorization-requirements]]
=== Authorizations requirements

[TIP]
====
Authorization (or authorization) allows you to give access to an application function (or "privilege" or "permission") to a user or a group of users.

Examples of functions: 'make an inter-bank transfer', 'view your account history', 'delete a user'

Be careful not to multiply the number of functions and roles to avoid a combinatorial explosion and associated management costs.

To simplify the management of authorizations by factorization, one can:

* Group users into groups (like `G_chief`).
* Associate a list of functions with a role (such as `R_administrator`,`R_banker_level_1`, `R_president`) that can be assigned to a person or to a group.

Example of a classic authorization management model:

image::diagrams/roles.svg[Classic role management]

Remember to specify the possible pseudo-users and their roles, for example:

* `@anonymous`: non-authenticated people
* `@connected`: authenticated people

Specify whether the application should use authorization delegation (OAuth2 type) and if so, is the application an authorization provider or consumer? What authorizations are concerned?
====

====
Example 1: people who are not logged in will have access to all read-only privileges
====
====
Example 2: the application will rely on a matrix authorization management of the type[roles] ->[groups or users] as described below. The details of the authorizations will be given in the specifications.
====

[[traceability-requirements]]
=== Traceability and auditability requirements

[TIP]
====
List here the trace requirements for detecting, for example:

* Misuse of back-office applications by employees
* Computer intrusions
* Data alteration

The traces are nominative and complete to allow auditing. They are therefore themselves sensitive and often require a good level of confidentiality.

Differentiate:

* Application traces, i.e., assessments of a complete use case such as 'Agent X consulted Ms. Y's file' and that are stored in databases;
* ... and the application traces (logs) as in a log file: `[INFO] 2016/12/23 11:14[Agent X] Call of the consult service` which are of technical level and much more volatile.

For the most sensitive data, it is possible to provide traceability at two levels (tracing the consultation of traces) to avoid abusive hierarchical traceability.

The traceability of the data of the repositories (base of people typically) requires a complete historization, which is in any case a good practice. To do this, provide an MCD allowing a record to be added for each change with a modification date and an effective date.
====

====
Example 1: for module X, any business action (update or consultation) must be the subject of a application trace containing at least the agent, the date and in case of modification the previous and the new value.
====
====
Example 2: Any intrusion into the IS must be detected (as far as possible).
====
====
Example 3: We need to be able to reconstruct the history of any patient's record at any date.
====

| Tax notice PDF
| No alteration
| Digital signature of the net amount + date + name in PKCS#7 (RSA, SHA256) format with timestamp. The resulting signature will be integrated a posteriori in hexadecimal format at the footer of the PDF.
|===

=== Confidentiality

Measures meeting the <<confidentiality-requirements>>:

.Measures to ensure the requested level of confidentiality
[cols="e,e,e"]
|===
| Data class | Required level | Measures

| Editorial content
| Public
| Network flows in HTTPS, no authentication

| Website Account Profile
| Limited
| Access to this content requires successful authentication by login/password

| Account history
| Reserved
| Access to this content is reserved for authorized operators, only via PL/SQL queries from the database

| Logs of user activities
| Reserved
| Access to the log files is reserved for authorized operators (SSH access to machine M and Unix password)

| HR data social assistance to employees
| Private
| This data is encrypted in AES 256 in the form of a BLOB in the database, sent to the Web client via the REST Y service then decrypted in the browser in the Angular application (forge.js library) via an additional password of the user (not stored on the server side). +
This is client-side only encryption. Loss of password makes data unrecoverable. Data changed on the client is encrypted and saved back to the BLOB through the REST X service.
|===

[TIP]
====
Also consider the confidentiality of derived data:

* encryption of backups;
* encryption of desktops. This can be hardware encryption in SED (Self Encryption Disk), software encryption at partition level (SafeGuard, dm-crypt) or file level (GnuPG, OpenSSL, TrueCrypt, etc.)
====

=== Identification

Measures meeting the <<identification-requirements>> :

_Example 1: The user ID of the application will be the uid attribute of the DNs `cn=XXX, ou=service1, dc=company, dc=com` in the central LDAP directory. A filter will also be applied on the membership of the group `ou=my application, dc=company, dc= com`._

_Example 2: To ensure that the IDs of deleted accounts are not reused, a history table will be added to the application and requested before any new account is created._

=== Authentication

Measures meeting the <<authentication-requirements>>:
[TIP]
====
For password authentication, describe how it is stored and verified. Also remember to describe the password updating solutions.
====
====
Example 1: The authentication of registered Internet users will be done by login/password (respecting the company password policy)
====
====
Example 2: The authentication of Internet users upon registration will be done by entering the Internet user code appearing on the invoices + the value of the last invoice and then by activating the account via a link appearing in a verification email.
====
====
Example 3: when creating a new beneficiary in the online bank app, the user will have to provide a unique password from their OTP token in addition to being authenticated.
====
====
Example 4: Passwords will in no case be kept plaintext but stored in the form of bcrypt digest.
====

==== Service accounts

[TIP]
====
Service accounts should only be used for authentication to a technical component from a batch or an API.
====

.Service accounts
[cols = '1e,2e,2e']
|====
| Account | Resource requiring authentication | How credentials are stored?

| JDBC accounts (one account per database) | PG and SqlServer instances.
| Clear storage in the configuration of data sources. Valued from a vault.
|====


=== Identity federation

Measures meeting the <<identity-federation-requirements>>:

[TIP]
====
The most common solutions are currently: OpenId Connect (OIDC), SAML or OAuth 2.0 (pseudo-authentication only for the latter).

For Web applications, specify the browser constraints (activation of cookies in particular).
====

====
Example: The end-user website leverages Google https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect[OIDC API] to handle authentication. 
====

=== SSO, SLO

Measures meeting the <<sso-requirements>>:
[TIP]
====
Detail the chosen technology and its integration. Some common solutions: Keycloak, Shibboleth, CAS, OpenAM. For Web applications, specify the browser constraints (activation of cookies in particular).
====
====
Example 1: The GUI X will integrate a CAS spring-security client for SSO. The Shibboleth server used will be YYY. Its authentication realm will be the AD Y directory.
====
====
Example 2: Like every business portal application, GUI X will have to manage disconnection callbacks from the Shibboleth server following an SLO request.
====

=== Non-repudiation

Measures meeting the <<non-repudiation-requirements>>:

====
Example: The tax return will be signed by the user's client certificate (X509, RSA, SHA-256 certificate) which was provided to him by the X component.
====

=== Anonymity and privacy

Measures meeting the <<privacy-requirements>>:

====
Example 1: an internal audit will be carried out once a year on the content of the database data and the extractions intended for partners.
====
====
Example 2: data destined for the public zone will be partially exported via a `COPY (SELECT…) TO <file>`. Sensitive columns will thus be excluded from replication.
====
====
Example 3: the cookie acceptance banner will be implemented on all pages of the Angular application via the `angular-cookie-law` module.
====

=== Authorizations

Measures meeting the <<authorization-requirements>>:
====
Example 1: Authorization management will be managed by application and stored in the PostgreSQL application database. These tables will be described in the specification file.
====
====
Example 2: Obtaining the Facebook address book will be in OAuth2. We will use the Google OAuth2 Java API.
====

=== Traceability, auditability

Measures meeting the <<traceability-requirements>>:

====
Example 1: At the end of each business action, the ReactJS application will invoke a business trace REST service asynchronously. This service will store the traces in an Elastic Search database for consultation in Kibana.
====
====
Example 2: the hybrid IDS tool (network + host) OSSEC will be installed on all the machines used by the application.
====
====
Example 3: The tables X, Y, .. will store data in a historical way according to the following principle:… <class diagram>
====
====
Example 4: all the documents used as proof will be archived.
====
====
Example 5: The logs containing the `[PROOF]` tag from any component will be centralized via the Elastic Search log centralization system and then inserted with Logstash processing on a daily basis to the Elastic `proof` index.
====


== Self-checks

=== Self-check for vulnerabilities

[TIP]
====
Vulnerability management is well beyond the scope of this document, but it is good practice to monitor yourself to ensure that the most common vulnerabilities are addressed and how. This list is partly from the TOP 10 OWASP. Of course, there are many other control points depending on the context of the application.
