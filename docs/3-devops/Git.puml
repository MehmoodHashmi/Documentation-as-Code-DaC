* **Git**
** **Definition**
*** Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code and other files during software development.
**[#pink] **Concepts**
*** Repository
**** A central location where a Git project is stored, containing all the files and folders as well as the commit history.
*** Commit
**** A record of changes made to a repository. Commits are used to save and track changes made to files over time.
*** Branch
**** A separate line of development in a repository. Branches allow developers to work on features or bug fixes in isolation from the main codebase.
*** Merge
**** The process of combining changes made in one branch with another. Merging allows developers to integrate changes made in separate branches back into the main codebase.
*** Pull Request
**** A request to merge changes from one branch into another. Pull requests provide a way for developers to review and discuss changes before they are merged into the main codebase.
*** Fork
**** A copy of a repository that allows developers to work on their own version of the project without affecting the original codebase.
*** Tag
**** A named pointer to a specific commit in a repository. Tags are used to mark significant points in a project's history, such as a release.
**[#pink] **Commands**
*** Clone
**** The process of creating a local copy of a remote repository.
*** Add
**** The process of staging changes made to files in a repository for inclusion in a commit.
*** Commit
**** The process of saving changes made to files in a repository.
*** Push
**** The process of uploading local changes to a remote repository.
*** Pull
**** The process of downloading changes from a remote repository and merging them into a local repository.
*** Merge
**** The process of combining changes made in one branch with another.
*** Rebase
**** The process of applying changes made in one branch to another, rewriting the commit history to create a linear history.
** **Hosting Services**
*** GitHub
**** A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. GitHub provides features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools.
*** GitLab
**** A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. GitLab provides features such as continuous integration, issue tracking, and collaboration tools.
*** Bitbucket
**** A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Bitbucket provides features such as pull requests, code reviews, and collaboration tools.
** Advantages
*** Distributed Version Control

*** Collaboration
*** Security
*** Easy to Learn
** Challenges
*** Learning Curve
***[#pink] **Conflicts and Merge Issues**
*** Complexity
*** Repository Size
*** Disk Space Usage
*** File Management
*** Repository Management
** Best Practices
*** Use descriptive commit messages
*** **Create small, focused commits**
*** **Use branching and merging effectively**
*** Use pull requests for code reviews
*** Keep the repository clean and organized
*** **Use tags to mark significant points in the project's history**
*** Regularly backup the repository
*** **Use gitignore to ignore files and folders that do not belong in the repository**
