*[#darkblue] <i>Feature Branch Workflow
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Overview
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Utilizes Individual Branches for Features
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**Each feature or task** developed in a <b>dedicated branch.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Facilitates Parallel Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Developers work on <b>"features" concurrently.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Integration through Merge or Rebase
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**Feature branches merged** into the <b>main branch.

***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Master/Main Branch
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Represents the stable and deployable state of the project.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Feature Branches
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Dedicated branches for specific features or tasks.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Commits and Updates
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Developers commit changes to their feature branches.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Pull Requests (Optional)\n<img:images/img_11.png{scale=.7}>

**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Workflow Characteristics
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Parallel Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Enables concurrent work on multiple features.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Isolation and Experimentation
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Allows for feature development without affecting the main codebase.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Enhanced Collaboration
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Facilitates collaborative code review and testing before merging.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Process Flow
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Create Feature Branch
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Developers create a new branch from the main branch for a specific feature or task.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Work on Feature
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Developers make changes and commit to their feature branch.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Code Review (Optional)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Peer review via pull requests for feedback and improvement.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Merge to Main
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Feature branches merged into the main branch after completion and review.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Advantages
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Isolated Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Enables focused work on individual features without impacting the main codebase.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Collaboration and Review
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Allows for collaboration, code review, and testing before integration.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Risk Mitigation
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Minimizes the risk of breaking the main branch with experimental changes.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Considerations
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Branch Management Overhead
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Requires proper branch creation, tracking, and merging practices.
