*[#darkblue] <i>Feature Branch Workflow
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Overview
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Utilizes Individual Branches for Features
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Each feature or task developed in a dedicated branch.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Facilitates Parallel Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Developers work on features concurrently.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Integration through Merge or Rebase
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Feature branches merged into the main branch.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Main Components
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Master/Main Branch
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Represents the stable and deployable state of the project.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Feature Branches
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Dedicated branches for specific features or tasks.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Commits and Updates
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Developers commit changes to their feature branches.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Pull Requests (Optional)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>PRs used for code review and merging changes.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Workflow Characteristics
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Parallel Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Enables concurrent work on multiple features.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Isolation and Experimentation
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Allows for feature development without affecting the main codebase.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Enhanced Collaboration
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Facilitates collaborative code review and testing before merging.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Process Flow
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Create Feature Branch
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Developers create a new branch from the main branch for a specific feature or task.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Work on Feature
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Developers make changes and commit to their feature branch.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Code Review (Optional)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Peer review via pull requests for feedback and improvement.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Merge to Main
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Feature branches merged into the main branch after completion and review.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Advantages
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Isolated Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Enables focused work on individual features without impacting the main codebase.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Collaboration and Review
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Allows for collaboration, code review, and testing before integration.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Risk Mitigation
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Minimizes the risk of breaking the main branch with experimental changes.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Considerations
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Branch Management Overhead
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Requires proper branch creation, tracking, and merging practices.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Synchronization Challenges
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Potential conflicts during merging with the main branch.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Workflow Complexity
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Increased complexity compared to the Centralized Workflow.
