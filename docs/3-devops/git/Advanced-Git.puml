**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Rebasing
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Rebasing is the process of moving changes made in one branch onto another, allowing for a linear history. \n*<i><color #black><size:14>Before pushing to **remote (repository)** perform **rebase** it will bring order in all commits
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Benefits
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Simplifies the commit history
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Reduces merge conflicts
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Improves readability of the commit history
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Submodules
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Submodules are repositories within repositories. They allow developers to include external dependencies within their own projects.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Benefits
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Simplifies dependency management
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Allows for modular design
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Eases collaboration between teams
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Cherry-picking
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Cherry-picking is the process of selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them to another branch.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Benefits
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Allows for selective merging of changes
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Useful for backporting bug fixes to stable releases
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Helps avoid merge conflicts
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Stashing\n<img:images/img_1.png{scale=.9}>
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Stashing is the process of temporarily storing changes made to a repository, allowing developers to \n<i><color #black><size:14>switch to a different branch or work on a different task without losing their progress.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Benefits
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Allows for temporary storage of changes
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Prevents loss of work
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Useful for switching between tasks or branches
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Bisecting
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Bisecting is the process of identifying the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Benefits
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Saves time and effort in identifying the cause of a bug
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Useful for large codebases with complex commit histories
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:22>[[a Workflows]]
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>**Workflows** are **defined processes** for using **Git** in a **team environment.** "Different workflows" offer different **approaches** to <b>collaboration & integration of changes.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Examples
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Centralized Workflow
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Feature Branch Workflow

****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Forking Workflow
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Hooks
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow. They can be used to automate tasks or enforce rules.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Examples
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Pre-commit Hook
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Post-commit Hook
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Pre-push Hook
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Update Hook
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Tips and Tricks
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Use "Git aliases" to "simplify" frequently used commands
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Use "Git hooks" to "enforce" coding standards and best practices
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Use "Git blame" to "identify" who made changes to specific lines of code
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Use "Git bisect" to "identify" the commit that introduced a bug
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Use "Git stash" to "temporarily" store changes
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Use "Git reflog" to "recover" lost commits
