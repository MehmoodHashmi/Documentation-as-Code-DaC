* Docker
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Docker** is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into portable, lightweight containers for easy deployment and scalability.

**[#lime] ====Key Concepts
*** Containers
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Isolated environments that contain applications and their dependencies.
*** Images
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Templates for creating containers, containing application code and dependencies.
*** Docker Engine
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Software that manages containers and runs them on a host system.

** Docker Benefits
*** Portability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Applications and dependencies packaged together, making them easily transferable.
*** Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Efficiently scale applications up or down using containers.
*** Isolation
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Isolates applications, preventing conflicts between dependencies.
*** Version Control
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Track and manage different versions of applications using images.

**[#orange] ====Docker Components
*** Docker Hub
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A repository for sharing and distributing Docker images.
*** Docker Compose
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
*** Docker Swarm
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Native clustering and orchestration for Docker.

** Docker Ecosystem
*** Kubernetes
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>An open-source container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.
*** Docker Compose
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
*** Docker Registry
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>A storage and distribution system for Docker images.

**[#gold] ====Use Cases
*** Microservices
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Decompose applications into smaller, manageable services.
*** DevOps
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Streamline development, testing, and deployment processes.
*** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment **(CI/CD)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Automate testing and deployment pipelines.

**[#pink] ====Considerations
*** Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Secure your Docker environment and containers.
*** Network Configuration
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define network settings for container communication.
*** Storage Management
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Configure and manage storage for persistent data.

*** Resource Management
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Control resource allocation for containers to ensure optimal performance.

** Best Practices
*** Use Smaller Base Images
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Start with lightweight base images to minimize container size.
*** Avoid Running as Root
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Run containers with non-root users to improve security.
*** Regular Updates
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Keep Docker and images updated for security and features.
*** Container Orchestration
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Implement orchestration tools like Kubernetes for complex deployments.
