* DevOps
** Definition
***[#a] ====<size:14>**[[devops.puml DevOps]]** is a set of **practices and cultural philosophies** that aims to __automate and integrate the processes of software development__ **(Dev)** and IT operations **(Ops)** to achieve continuous delivery and improve \n<size:14>//software quality and efficiency.//

** Key Concepts
*** Continuous Integration **(CI)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Automating the process of code integration and validation.
*** Continuous Delivery **(CD)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Automatically deploying code to production or staging environments.
*** Infrastructure as Code **(IaC)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code.
***[#gold] ====**Automation**
****[#yellow] ====<size:18>**Reducing manual, repetitive tasks through scripting and tooling.**
***[#orange] ====**Collaboration**
****[#pink] ====<size:16>**Encouraging cross-functional teamwork and communication.**
*** Monitoring and Feedback
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Collecting and analyzing data to inform improvements.

** DevOps Practices
*** Version Control
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Using tools like **Git** to manage and track changes in code.
*** Continuous Integration **(CI)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Building and testing** code __automatically__ upon **commits.**
*** Continuous Delivery **(CD)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Deploying code to various environments in an automated fashion.
*** Configuration Management
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Managing infrastructure and application configurations.
*** Containers and Orchestration
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Using containerization **(e.g., Docker)** and orchestrators **(e.g., Kubernetes)**.
*** Release Management
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Planning, scheduling, and controlling software releases.
*** Monitoring and Logging
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Collecting data and generating logs for analysis.
***[#white] ====<size:14>**Security**
****[#lightgreen] ====<size:14>**Integrating security practices** into the **DevOps pipeline.**

** DevOps Tools
*** Version Control
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Git, SVN, and Mercurial.
*** CI/CD
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD.
*** Containerization
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Docker** and container orchestration tools **(e.g., Kubernetes)**.
*** Configuration Management
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.
*** Collaboration
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Chat and communication tools **(e.g., Slack)**.
*** Monitoring and Logging
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.
*** IaC
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Terraform, Pulumi and CloudFormation.
***[#white] ====<size:14>**Security**
****[#lightgreen] ====<size:14>**Tools for vulnerability scanning and security audits.**

**[#gold] ====DevOps Lifecycle
*** Plan
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Define project goals and requirements.
*** Code
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Write and maintain code.
*** Build
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Compile, build, and package code.
*** Test
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Validate code quality through testing.
*** Deploy
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Deploy code to various environments.
*** Operate
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Manage and monitor deployed applications.
*** Monitor
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Collect data and feedback for continuous improvement.

** Benefits of DevOps
*** Faster Delivery
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Speeding up software development and deployment.
*** Improved Quality
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Enhanced testing and reduced defects.
*** Increased Collaboration
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
*** Greater Scalability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Handling increased workloads and complexity.
*** Enhanced Security
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Integrating security practices from the start.
