* Monitoring and Logging
** Definition
***[#white] ====<size:15>**Monitoring and Logging** involve "tracking and recording" the "behavior, performance, and events" of "systems and applications" to ensure their "health, security, and performance".

** Key Concepts
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Continuous observation and measurement of system activities.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Logging
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Recording events, errors, and activities for analysis.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Metrics
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Quantitative data representing system performance.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Alerts
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Notifications triggered by predefined conditions.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Dashboards
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Visual representations of system status and metrics.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Anomaly Detection
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Identifying deviations from normal system behavior.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Retention
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Storing logs and metrics for a defined period.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Centralized Logging
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Aggregating logs from multiple sources in one location.

** Monitoring Types
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Infrastructure Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Monitoring hardware, network, and system resources.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Application Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tracking the performance and health of software applications.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Security Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Detecting security threats and vulnerabilities.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>User Experience **(UX)** Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Measuring user interactions and satisfaction.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Log Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Analyzing logs for errors and patterns.

** Logging Levels
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Debug
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Detailed information for debugging.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Info
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>General operational information.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Warning
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Indications of potential issues.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Error
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Errors that do not halt system operation.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Critical
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Critical errors requiring immediate attention.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Alert
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Immediate action required for severe issues.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Emergency
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>System-wide emergency conditions.

****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Tools like New Relic, AppDynamics.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Uptime Monitoring
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Services like Pingdom, Uptrends.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Syslog
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Standard for logging messages in network devices.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Logstash
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Part of the ELK Stack for log processing.
***[#gold] ====<size:18>**Grafana**
