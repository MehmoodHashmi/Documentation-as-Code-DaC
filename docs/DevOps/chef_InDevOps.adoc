* The Chef is a *#configuration management#* *tool*.
* System administrator role is to manage machines, install any required s/w etc. like in wah university lab admin.

* *DevOps engineer* now replaces the *system administrator* job at those organizations which has moved toward automation & *cloud computing*.

*#Configuration:#* each & every detail of your machine** (storage, server, the whole state of machine in terms of hardware & software).**

* *Configuration management tools:*

** *Push-based* (push configuration server pushes configuration to the nodes)

.Ansibile & saltstack both are push-based tools

** *Pull based* (pull configuration nodes check with the server periodically & fetches the configuration from it)

*Cheff & puppet* both pull-based tools, chef is new in market & it is open source s/w while puppet is old.

=== cheff architecture and process

Chef is a configuration management system designed to bring automation to infrastructure. It can be used to manage nodes running OSs such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux distributions including Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS, Debian and Fedora.

Chef is an open-source automation platform that provides a way to define *infrastructure as code*. The Chef architecture consists of two main components, *the Chef Client and the Chef Server*.

1. *The Chef Client* runs on each managed *node* and communicates with the Chef Server,
which stores the configurations and data from all of the clients.
The Chef Client processes resources, which are defined in a language called Ruby and stored in files called *“recipes”.*
** These *recipes* contain instructions for configuring the node, such as installing and configuring packages,
creating users and files,
etc.

3. *The Chef Server* then compiles the recipes into instructions that the Chef Client can understand,
allowing it to configure the node according to the recipe.
Additionally, the Chef Server maintains a *library of cookbooks*,
which are Cookbooks that contain more complex recipes
that facilitate the provisioning and configuration of different applications and services.

=== How to create "cookbook & recipe"

==== What is chef attribute
==== Insert Linux command, create user & group, runlist
==== What is bootstrapping in CHEF
*Bootstrap* is a command. Actually, it is software like *#git#*; we give commands of git like: _##Git status, git log --oneline etc.##_ kind of thing.

* Your "*workstation*" & " *node* (Linux machine)" should be in the same *"availability zone or AZ"*. Why? Because it's recommended. But you can deviate from it in case you need it to do so. Given the conditions, you understand the consequences.
** Actually, if you create " *node* (Linux machine)" in the same AZ availability zone, then you can access this node through private IP of this node otherwise you have to use public IP.

==== How to create role in chef
Creating a "role" & uploading the role on chef-server

*Docker & cheff* both work at same level of abstraction, but they've different responsibilites.

1. *Docker* will *#create a container#* for you while
2. *Chef* will do the *#configuration on that container#*
