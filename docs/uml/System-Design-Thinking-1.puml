title = System Design Thinking
*:System design thinking is an approach to problem-solving that involves understanding and addressing complex systems and their components. It focuses on identifying
the relationships between different elements within a system, as well as the interactions between those elements and their environment. This approach is particularly
useful for designing and optimizing large-scale systems, such as software architectures, organizational structures, and business processes.
Here's a PlantUML mindmap script that outlines advanced system design thinking:;
