* Advanced Reactive Data Stream

** Reactive Extensions (Rx)

*** Definition
**** Library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences
**** Provides a wide range of operators for manipulating and transforming reactive data streams

*** Key Concepts
**** Observables
***** Represents a stream of data or events that can be observed and processed
***** Emits data items asynchronously to subscribers

**** Observers
***** Subscribes to observables and reacts to emitted data items or events
***** Processes the data items asynchronously as they arrive

**** Operators
***** Functions for transforming, filtering, combining, or manipulating the data stream
***** Enables complex operations on the data items emitted by observables

**** Schedulers
***** Control the execution and concurrency of reactive code
***** Enable specifying the execution context and thread pool for observables and operators

** Reactive Streams

*** Definition
**** Specification for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure
**** Enables interoperability and composability of reactive systems and libraries

*** Backpressure
**** Mechanism for controlling the rate of data flow in a reactive data stream
**** Ensures that subscribers can handle the data they receive without being overwhelmed

** Reactive Systems

*** Definition
**** Systems that are responsive, elastic, resilient, and message-driven
**** Built using reactive programming principles and patterns

*** Characteristics
**** Responsiveness
***** Provides timely responses and handles a large number of concurrent requests

**** Elasticity
***** Can scale up or down based on the workload and resource availability

**** Resilience
***** Handles failures gracefully and recovers from errors

**** Message-Driven
***** Relies on asynchronous message passing between components

** Advanced Techniques

*** Stream Windowing
**** Divides the data stream into finite, overlapping, or non-overlapping time intervals
**** Enables time-based operations and analysis on the data stream

*** Event Time Processing
**** Assigns timestamps to events based on their occurrence time
**** Enables accurate analysis and handling of out-of-order events

*** Stream Joining and Aggregation
**** Combines multiple data streams based on shared attributes or keys
**** Performs aggregation operations on the combined data

*** Complex Event Processing (CEP)
**** Identifies complex patterns and correlations in the data stream
**** Enables real-time analysis and detection of complex events
