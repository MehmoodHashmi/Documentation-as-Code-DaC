title =Design by Capability Approach

* Capabilities
** Identify business capabilities that need to be supported by the system.
** Break down capabilities into smaller functional areas.
** Create a capability map to visualize and communicate the relationships between capabilities.
* Components
** Design components that support each capability or functional area.
** Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
** Components should be designed to be reusable and replaceable.
* Interfaces
** Design interfaces between components to enable communication and collaboration.
** Interfaces should be designed to be technology agnostic and future-proof.
** Interfaces should be designed to be simple and easy to understand.
* Services
** Design services that provide access to capabilities.
** Services should be designed to be technology agnostic and platform-independent.
** Services should be designed to be easy to use and understand.
* Benefits
** Improved Business Alignment: Ensures that the system supports the business capabilities.
** Improved Agility: Enables the system to evolve and adapt to changing business needs.
** Improved Modularity: Promotes the creation of reusable and replaceable components.
** Improved Interoperability: Facilitates the integration of the system with other systems and services.
** Improved Quality: Enables more effective testing and validation of the system.
* Applications
** Enterprise Architecture: Design by Capability can be applied to enterprise architecture.
** Service-Oriented Architecture: Design by Capability can be applied to service-oriented architecture.
** Agile Development: Design by Capability can be applied to agile development.
** DevOps: Design by Capability can be applied to DevOps.

*[#pink] **Definition**
** A design approach that focuses on identifying and defining business capabilities to drive the design of software systems.
* Benefits
** Improves alignment between business needs and technology solutions.
** Enables more flexible and adaptable systems that can evolve with changing business needs.
** Promotes modularity and reuse of components.
** Facilitates integration with other systems and services.
** Enables more effective testing and validation of the system.
*[#yellow] **Steps**
** Identify business capabilities.
** Break down capabilities into smaller functional areas.
** Create a capability map to visualize and communicate the relationships between capabilities.
** Design components that support each capability or functional area.
** Design interfaces between components to enable communication and collaboration.
** Design services that provide access to capabilities.
* Key Principles
** Capability-driven: The design is driven by business capabilities, rather than technical requirements.
** Modular: The system is broken down into smaller, more manageable components that can be reused and replaced.
** Service-oriented: The system is designed as a set of services that provide access to capabilities.
** Technology agnostic: The system is designed to be technology-independent and able to adapt to changing technology trends.
* Applications
** Enterprise Architecture: Design by Capability can be applied to enterprise architecture.
** Service-Oriented Architecture: Design by Capability can be applied to service-oriented architecture.
** Agile Development: Design by Capability can be applied to agile development.
** DevOps: Design by Capability can be applied to DevOps.
