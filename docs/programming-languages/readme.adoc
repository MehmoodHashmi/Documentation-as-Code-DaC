XML, YAML, JSON, HTML, XHTML, CSS etc. are type of external DSLs.

One thing very important I learned was:
. especially DSL written in XML, YAML can be used with any programming language

. on the other hand if you have written a DSL with Kotlin that is an internal DSL then, it will be used by people who know kotlin language.

internal DSL are language dependent while external DSLs are language independent
