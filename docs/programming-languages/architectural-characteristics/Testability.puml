* Testability
** Definition
*** The degree to which a system or component facilitates the creation and execution of tests
*** A measure of how easily a software system or component can be tested
** Characteristics
*** Observability
**** Ability to observe system behavior and internal state during test execution
**** Includes logging, monitoring, and tracing mechanisms
*** Controllability
**** Ability to control the system behavior and internal state during test execution
**** Includes configuration, mocking, and stubbing mechanisms
*** Isolation
**** Ability to isolate a specific portion of the system or component for testing
**** Includes modular design and dependency injection mechanisms
*** Automatability
**** Ability to automate the testing process
**** Includes frameworks for test automation and scripting languages for test scripts
*** Reusability
**** Ability to reuse tests across different environments and scenarios
**** Includes test case management tools and test data management mechanisms
** Benefits
*** Faster development cycle
*** Lower cost of testing
*** Higher quality of software
*** Improved maintainability and modularity of the system
** Techniques
*** Unit testing
**** Testing individual units of code in isolation from the rest of the system
**** Requires modular design and dependency injection mechanisms
*** Integration testing
**** Testing the interactions between different units or components of the system
**** Requires controllability and observability mechanisms
*** System testing
**** Testing the system as a whole to ensure it meets the requirements and specifications
**** Requires automatability and reusability mechanisms
** Tools
*** Testing frameworks
**** JUnit, TestNG, NUnit, etc.
**** Provide a set of libraries and tools for writing and executing tests
*** Test automation tools
**** Selenium, Appium, TestComplete, etc.
**** Provide a set of tools for automating the testing process
*** Test case management tools
**** TestRail, Zephyr, qTest, etc.
**** Provide a platform for managing test cases and test suites
*** Test data management tools
**** Test Data Manager, GenRocket, etc.
**** Provide a mechanism for managing test data and generating test data sets
** Best practices
*** Test early and often
*** Use the right level of testing
*** Test in isolation
*** Use test doubles
*** Automate as much as possible
*** Use a continuous integration and delivery pipeline
*** Use code coverage metrics
*** Maintain and update tests regularly
