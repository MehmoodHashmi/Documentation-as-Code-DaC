* Availability
** Definition Availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition, taking into account both planned and unplanned downtime.
** Key Concepts
*** **Uptime:** The amount of time the system is operational and available to users.
*** **Downtime:** The amount of time the system is not operational and unavailable to users.
*** **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** The average time between system failures.
*** **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** The average time it takes to recover from a system failure.
*** **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** A commitment between service provider and user that outlines the expected availability and performance of the system.
** Importance
*** Ensures users can access the system when needed.
*** Prevents loss of revenue and customer trust due to downtime.
*** Helps businesses meet SLAs and avoid penalties.
** Strategies
*** Redundancy: Duplicating system components to ensure that a backup is available in case of failure.
*** Load balancing: Distributing workload across multiple servers to prevent overloading and increase fault tolerance.
*** Failover: Automatically switching to a backup system when the primary system fails.
*** Disaster recovery: Having a plan in place to quickly recover from a major system failure.
** Considerations
*** Costs: Implementing high-availability strategies can be expensive.
*** Complexity: Increasing availability often involves adding more components, which can increase system complexity.
*** Scalability: High availability strategies may impact system scalability if not designed properly.
