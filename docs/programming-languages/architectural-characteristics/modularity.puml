title = Modularity

* Modularity
** Definition
*** Breaking down a system into smaller, independent components with well-defined interfaces
*** Each component can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
** Benefits
*** Easier to reason about and understand
*** Encourages code reuse
*** Makes it easier to maintain and modify code
*** Reduces the impact of changes
** Types of Modularity
*** Physical modularity
**** Based on how the components are physically separated
**** Components can be in different files, packages, or modules
*** Logical modularity
**** Based on how the components are logically separated
**** Components can be separated based on their responsibilities or functionality
*** Layered modularity
**** Based on how the components are layered on top of each other
**** Each layer provides an abstraction over the layer below it
*** Aspect-oriented modularity
**** Separates components based on cross-cutting concerns
**** AOP can be used to implement this type of modularity
** Techniques for achieving modularity
*** Modular design
**** Designing a system with modularity in mind
**** Components should have well-defined responsibilities and interfaces
*** Modular programming
**** Writing code that is easily divided into independent, reusable components
**** Components should be loosely coupled and have minimal dependencies
*** Dependency injection
**** Injecting dependencies into components at runtime
**** Allows for components to be easily replaced or modified
*** Event-driven architecture
**** Components communicate with each other using events
**** Components do not need to know about each other, just the events they produce or consume
