title = Reliability

* Reliability
** Definition
*** Ability of a system to function properly and consistently under varying conditions
** Importance
*** Crucial for mission-critical systems
*** Builds trust with users
** Types of Failures
*** Transient
**** Temporary failure that disappears quickly
**** Can be recovered from without major impact
*** Intermittent
**** Failure that occurs randomly over time
**** Hard to diagnose and fix
*** Permanent
**** Failure that persists until fixed
**** Requires repair or replacement of the affected component
** Techniques to Ensure Reliability
*** Redundancy
**** Providing duplicate components that can take over if one fails
**** Can be expensive but highly effective
*** Fault Tolerance
**** Ability of a system to continue operation even in the presence of faults
**** Built-in redundancy, error detection, and correction mechanisms
*** Error Handling
**** Gracefully handling errors to minimize their impact
**** Logging and reporting errors to facilitate diagnosis and resolution
*** Testing and Validation
**** Comprehensive testing and validation of all system components
**** Can uncover and address potential failures before they occur
** Metrics for Measuring Reliability
*** Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
**** Average time between system failures
**** Useful for assessing the reliability of systems that can be repaired or replaced
*** Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
**** Average time until a component fails
**** Useful for assessing the reliability of systems that cannot be repaired or replaced
*** Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
**** Average time to repair a failed component
**** Useful for assessing the maintainability of a system
