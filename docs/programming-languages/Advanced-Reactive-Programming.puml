title = Advanced Reactive Programming

* Advanced Reactive Programming
** Reactive Streams
*** Specification for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.
*** Defines a standard set of interfaces, classes, and protocols for reactive libraries.
*** Enables interoperability between different reactive libraries.
** Back Pressure
*** Mechanism to control the flow of data between publishers and subscribers.
*** Allows subscribers to communicate their readiness to handle new data.
*** Prevents overload and provides a way to handle slow consumers.
** Hot vs. Cold Observables
*** Cold observables start emitting data when a subscriber subscribes to them.
*** Hot observables emit data regardless of whether there are active subscribers.
*** Hot observables are useful for broadcasting events to multiple subscribers.
** Error Handling
*** Reactive programming provides mechanisms to handle errors in data streams.
*** Operators like `onErrorResumeNext`, `retry`, and `catch` can handle errors gracefully.
*** Errors can be propagated to subscribers or transformed into alternative streams.
** Threading and Schedulers
*** Reactive programming supports concurrency and threading.
*** Schedulers manage the execution context for observables and their subscribers.
*** Schedulers provide control over thread pooling, parallelism, and execution order.
** State Management
*** Advanced reactive programming addresses state management challenges.
*** Tools like state containers, immutable data structures, and reducers can be used.
*** Unidirectional data flow architectures (e.g., Redux) can be applied for complex states.
** Advanced Operators
*** Reactive libraries provide a wide range of advanced operators for complex scenarios.
*** Examples include windowing, grouping, throttling, time-based operations, and more.
*** These operators allow fine-grained control over data streams and transformations.
** Testing and Debugging
*** Reactive programming frameworks offer testing and debugging utilities.
*** Tools like test schedulers, test subscribers, and mock observables facilitate testing.
*** Debugging features help diagnose issues in complex reactive pipelines.
