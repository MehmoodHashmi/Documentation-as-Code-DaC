** Definition
*** Advanced patterns used to design and implement complex microservices architectures.
**[#pink] **Categories**
*** Service Design
**** Event-Driven Microservices
**** Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
**** Micro-Frontends
**** Service Mesh
**** API Gateway
**** Service Registry
**** Sidecar
**** BFF (Backend for Frontend)
**** Service Decomposition
**** Service Composition
**** Service Versioning
**** Service Discovery
**** Reactive Programming
**** Reactive System
**** Circuit Breaker
**** Bulkhead
**** Blue/Green Deployment
*** Operations
**** Microservices Observability
**** Tracing
**** Logging
**** Metrics
**** Health Checking
**** Circuit Breaking
**** Chaos Engineering
**** Continuous Delivery
**** Canary Deployment
**** A/B Testing
*** Security
**** Access Token
**** API Key
**** OAuth 2.0
**** OpenID Connect
**** JWT (JSON Web Token)
**** Mutual TLS
**** Service Identity and Access Management
**** Rate Limiting
**** Content Security Policy
**** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
**** API Security Gateway
*** Data Management
**** Distributed Data Management
**** Database per Service
**** API Composition
**** Data Lake
**** Event Sourcing
**** CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
**** Database Sharding
**** Database Replication
**** SAGA (Stateless Architecture for Greater Agility)
**** Eventually Consistent Data
**** Polyglot Persistence
**** Distributed Transactions
**** Data Consistency
**** Data Partitioning
** Benefits
*** Increased Flexibility
*** Scalability
*** Resilience
*** Modularity
*** Agility
*** Reduced Coupling
*** Real-Time Processing
*** Data Consistency
*** Fine-Grained Control
** Challenges
*** Complexity
*** Distributed Transactions
*** Eventual Consistency
*** Microservices Security
*** Data Integration
*** Data Privacy
*** Governance
*** Testing
*** Operations
** Best practices
*** Use patterns to implement advanced microservices architecture
*** Use patterns where they make sense
*** Plan for failure
*** Use asynchronous communication
*** Use a central schema registry
*** Monitor microservices in real-time
*** Design for testing
*** Use distributed transactions with caution
*** Design for eventual consistency
*** Implement microservices security measures
*** Implement data integration, privacy, and governance measures
*** Plan for microservices operations
