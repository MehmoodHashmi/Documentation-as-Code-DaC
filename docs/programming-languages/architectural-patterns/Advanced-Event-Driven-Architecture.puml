*** Event sourcing
*** CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
*** Sagas
*** Event-driven microservices
*** Serverless functions
*** Cloud-native
*** Domain-driven design
** Components
*** Event sourcing
*** Command bus
*** Event bus
*** Sagas
*** CQRS
*** Domain events
*** Event-driven microservices
*** Serverless functions
** Benefits
*** Scalability
*** High availability
*** Resilience
*** Flexibility
*** Reduced coupling
*** Real-time processing
*** Simplified data management
** Challenges
*** Complexity
*** Eventual consistency
*** Error handling
*** Security
*** Testing
*** Deployment and orchestration
** Best practices
*** Choose the right event-driven technology
*** Design events carefully
*** Use event-driven architecture where it makes sense
*** Use domain-driven design
*** Use CQRS to separate read and write concerns
*** Use sagas to handle long-running processes
*** Use event sourcing for data storage
