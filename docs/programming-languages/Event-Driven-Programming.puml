title = Event-Driven Programming

* Event-Driven Programming
** Definition
*** A programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events or messages
** Key Concepts
*** Events
**** Occurrences that **trigger** the program to perform certain **actions**
*** **Event Handlers**
**** Code that responds to specific **events**
*** Event Loops (listener)
**** **Code that listens for events and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers**
** Examples
*** Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
**** Responding to user interactions (e.g. button clicks)
*** Web Applications
**** Responding to HTTP requests
*** IoT Devices
**** Responding to sensor data
** Benefits
*** Reactive and responsive
*** Efficient use of resources
*** Modular and extensible

* Event Handling Techniques
** Polling
*** Periodically checks for new events
** Callbacks
*** Registers a function to be called when an event occurs
** Event Queues
*** Maintains a list of events that are waiting to be processed
** Publish/Subscribe
*** Event-driven communication pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers).
** Channels
*** Dedicated communication paths between event producers and consumers
