title = __Choosing Between JVM Languages for a New Project__

* Considerations
** Project requirements
*** Performance
*** Scalability
*** Maintainability
*** Development speed
** Team expertise
*** Familiarity with language
*** Availability of developers
** Ecosystem and community support
*** Libraries and frameworks
*** Documentation and resources
*** Third-party integrations

* JVM Languages
** Java
*** Mature language with large community
*** Strongly typed with high level of abstraction
*** Good for enterprise applications and **large-scale systems**
** Kotlin
*** Modern language with good Java interoperability
*** Concise syntax and expressive language features
*** Good for building Android apps and **backend services**
** Scala
*** Object-oriented and functional language
*** High-level abstractions and powerful type system
*** Good for building **high-performance and distributed systems**
** Groovy
*** Dynamic language with a simple syntax
*** Good for scripting and rapid prototyping
*** Strong integration with Java
** Clojure
*** Functional language with a focus on immutability and concurrency
*** Dynamic and interactive development style
*** Good for building **highly concurrent and distributed systems**

* Decision Factors
** Project requirements
** Team expertise
** Ecosystem and community support
