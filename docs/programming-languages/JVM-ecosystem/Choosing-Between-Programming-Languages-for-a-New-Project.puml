title = __Choosing Between Programming Languages for a New Project__

* Considerations
** Project requirements
*** Performance
*** Scalability
*** Maintainability
*** Development speed
*** Platform compatibility
*** Licensing
*** Cost

** Team expertise
*** Familiarity with language
*** Availability of developers
*** Training and education

** Ecosystem and community support
*** Libraries and frameworks
*** Documentation and resources
*** Third-party integrations
*** Community and forums

* Programming Languages
** Python
*** Easy to learn and read
*** Strong community and ecosystem
*** Good for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing

** JavaScript
*** Widely used and versatile
*** Good for building web applications and front-end development
*** Node.js for server-side development

** Java
*** Mature language with large community
*** Strongly typed with high level of abstraction
*** Good for enterprise applications and large-scale systems

** Ruby
*** Simple and elegant syntax
*** High-level abstractions and metaprogramming
*** Good for web development and prototyping

** C++
*** High performance and low-level control
*** Good for systems programming and gaming
*** Used in operating systems and embedded systems

** Rust
*** High performance and low-level control
*** Memory safety and concurrency without garbage collector
*** Good for systems programming and networking

** Swift
*** Modern language for Apple platforms
*** Easy to learn and read
*** Good for building iOS, macOS, and watchOS apps

** Kotlin
*** Modern language with good Java interoperability
*** Concise syntax and expressive language features
*** Good for building Android apps and backend services
