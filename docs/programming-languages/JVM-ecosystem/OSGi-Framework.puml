* OSGi Framework
** Introduction
*** Modular architecture
*** Dynamic component model
*** Service registry
*** Versioning

** Benefits of OSGi
*** Reusability
*** Maintainability
*** Scalability
*** Flexibility
*** Reliability

** Core Concepts
*** Bundles
**** A modular and portable JAR file that contains classes, resources, and metadata
**** Can be installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled at runtime
**** Manifest file specifies bundle metadata
*** Services
**** A reusable and pluggable component that provides a well-defined interface for other components to interact with
**** Can be dynamically registered, discovered, and used by other components
*** Service Registry
**** A dynamic lookup service that allows components to register and discover services at runtime
*** Lifecycle
**** Framework lifecycle, bundle lifecycle, and service lifecycle

** OSGi Services
*** Service Interfaces
**** A Java interface that defines the methods for a service
*** Service Provider
**** A bundle that implements a service interface
*** Service Consumer
**** A bundle that uses the service provided by a service provider
*** Service Registration
**** The process of a bundle registering a service with the service registry
*** Service Discovery
**** The process of a bundle discovering available services in the service registry
*** Service Binding
**** The process of a bundle obtaining a reference to a service from the service registry

** OSGi Bundles
*** Bundle Manifest
**** The metadata file that defines the bundle, its dependencies, and services
*** Bundle Lifecycle
**** Installation, starting, stopping, updating, and uninstalling
*** Class Loading
**** The OSGi class loading model, including visibility and delegation

** OSGi Framework
*** Framework Architecture
**** The OSGi framework components and their interactions
*** Framework Extensions
**** The optional components that extend the OSGi framework, such as the Http Service and the JMX Service
*** Framework Security
**** The OSGi security model, including permissions and policies

** OSGi Tools
*** Apache Felix
**** An open-source implementation of the OSGi framework
*** Eclipse Equinox
**** An OSGi implementation used by the Eclipse IDE and other Eclipse-based products
*** Bnd
**** A tool for building OSGi bundles and libraries
*** OSGi enRoute
**** A collection of tools, libraries, and examples for building OSGi applications
