* Execution Engine

** Definition
*** Interprets and executes the program's instructions
*** Converts high-level code into machine-level instructions

**[#pink] **Types**
*** **Compiler**
**** Translates the entire source code into machine code before execution
**** Generates an executable file that can be directly run by the operating system
****[#pink] **Examples:** C, C++, Java (JVM-based languages)

*** **Interpreter**
**** Translates and executes the program line by line without prior compilation
**** Interprets and executes each line of code on the fly
****[#pink] **Examples:** Python, Ruby, JavaScript

*** **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**
**** Combines features of both compiler and interpreter
**** Translates code into machine code on the fly, but caches it for future use
**** Provides a balance between speed and flexibility
****[#pink] **Examples:** Java (JIT-compiled JVM bytecode), .NET languages (JIT compilation)

** Characteristics
*** Performance
**** Compilers generally offer faster execution due to precompiled machine code
**** Interpreters provide flexibility and dynamic runtime modifications
**** JIT compilers combine benefits of both approaches

*** Portability
**** Interpreters offer greater portability since they can run code directly on different platforms
**** Compilers require specific machine code generation for each target architecture

*** Debugging
**** Interpreters often provide better debugging capabilities with real-time inspection
**** Compilers may have limited debugging features due to optimization and transformation processes

** Usage
*** Language-specific
**** Execution engines may be designed for specific programming languages
**** Different languages may have their own dedicated execution engines

*** Platform-specific
**** Execution engines may be tailored for specific platforms or operating systems
****[#pink] **Examples:** Java Virtual Machine (JVM), .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR)
