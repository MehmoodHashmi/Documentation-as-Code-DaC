title =__ Data Parallelism__

* Data Parallelism
** **Definition:** Breaking up a **large dataset** into smaller chunks and processing them \nsimultaneously on multiple computing resources
*** **Example:** Dividing a large image into smaller sections and processing each section simultaneously on multiple processors
** **Benefits:**
*** Faster processing of large datasets
*** Better utilization of available computing resources
*** Higher throughput and reduced processing time
*** Scalable and efficient processing of large datasets
** **Techniques:**
*** SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)
*** MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data)
*** GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
*** FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
*** Distributed processing
** **Applications:**
*** Image and video processing
*** Machine learning and deep learning
*** Scientific simulations and calculations
*** Big data processing and analytics
**[#pink] **Frameworks and Libraries:**
*** Apache Hadoop
*** Apache Spark
*** TensorFlow
*** PyTorch
*** CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
*** OpenCL (Open Computing Language)
