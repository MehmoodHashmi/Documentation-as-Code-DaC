title =__ Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)__

* Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)
** Definition
*** A programming environment that allows you to interactively evaluate and run code
** Components
*** Read
**** Parses the user's input
*** Eval
**** Evaluates the parsed input as a program
*** Print
**** Outputs the result of the evaluation to the user
** Advantages
*** Faster feedback loop than traditional compile-run cycles
*** Allows for exploratory programming and rapid prototyping
*** Helpful for testing and debugging small pieces of code
** Disadvantages
*** Lack of compile-time error checking
*** Can be difficult to scale to larger codebases
*** Not suitable for use in production environments
** Examples
*** Python REPL (interactive mode)
*** Ruby IRB (Interactive Ruby)
*** Node.js REPL
*** Lisp REPL
