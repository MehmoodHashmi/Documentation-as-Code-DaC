Remember, your goal is to get the client talking about the project, both the issue and the solution.

Not all questions apply to all projects, but they represent a broad range of considerations that can help to think through what’s really needed.

== General Questions

* Who are the key stakeholders and users?

** Do their goals differ?

** If so, how?

* How do the project/system’s goals map to the department’s goals or needs?

* Will the project/system change the way you are doing things now?

* What will the project accomplish that is not currently accomplished manually or with other projects/software?

* Are there other projects/systems with which this project/system will interface?

* Is there any existing project/system documentation?

** If so, where?

* Who else should I talk to?



== Current Needs

* What department/business requirements will this project/system address?

* What information do you need from this project/system that you don’t have now?

* Is any of this data currently captured in any other project/system?

* Is the data and/or functionality shared by others?



== Current Problems

* What problems should this project/system solve?

* Do you have to do things manually that you would like to automate?

* Do you have performance problems that need to change?

* Do you have functional limitations that you’d like to change?

== Criteria for Success

* Are their resource constraints in maintaining the project/system

** Do you have the in-house expertise we need?

* Are there technical constraints to developing this project/system?
** What are they?



== Improving an Existing System

* Will the new project/system have additional functionality?

* Will the new project/system help you be more efficient?

** To what extent?

* What is most important (rank in order of importance):

** Application is easier to use

** Application has nicer front-end

** Application has additional functionality (list)

** Application is more efficient

** Application is redesigned to better reflect the business



== Criteria for Success

* What needs to happen to make this project/system successful?


== High-Level Functions

* Does the current system do things that this system will not do?

* How do these functions interact with each other?

* Are there other systems this system will interface with?
