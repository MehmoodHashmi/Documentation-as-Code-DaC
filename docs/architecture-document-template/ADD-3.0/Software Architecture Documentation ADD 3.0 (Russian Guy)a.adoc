== 	Introduction

=== Purpose

This SAD specifies the software architecture for #<insert scope of SAD>#.
All information regarding the software architecture may be found in this document,
although much information is incorporated by reference to other documents.

SAD elicits significant architecture drivers such as business, functional, non-functional requirements, constraints, and defines architecture.

This SAD is designed following ISO/lEC/lEEE42010 and based on the Software Engineering Institute's "View and Beyond" method for documenting software architectures

=== 	Scope
SAD specifies the order in which architecture descriptions of systems are organized and expressed.
The document describes an architecture that will satisfy business functional,
non-functional requirements, and constraints provided by the Client.

This SAD covers the following information:

1.  Significant architectural drivers
2.	Software architecture based on these drivers
3.	Technology Stack and environment definitions
4.	Operations Specific perspectives

=== 	Definitions
The Definition section lists the acronyms and terms used in this document that might possess less familiarity or double meaning to the reader.

=== 	Relationship to other SADs
This section describes the relationship between this SAD and other architecture documents, both system and software.
For example, a large project may choose to have one SAD that defines the [.underline]#*system-of-systems*# architecture,
and other SADs to define the architecture of
[.underline]#*systems or subsystems*#.
An embedded system may well have a system architecture document;
in which case this section would explain how the information in here traces to information there.

===	Service Level Agreement
The SLA section provides key parts of the Service Level Agreement applicable to the designed solution be supported by the proposed solution architecture.

====	Scope and applicability
This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") establishes the service quality parameters that are to be applied to the use of #<Project># services and is part of the #<Project># Services Customer Agreement.

The terms and conditions specified in this agreement apply solely to the services provided as callable API hosted by the company, herein called "Covered Services." This SLA applies separately to each service consumer ("Consumed') that is using the Covered Services. #<Client># reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the #<Project># Services Customer Agreement at any time.

====	Service Quality Guarantees
The Covered Services will be operational and available to Consumers at least 99.95% of the time in any calendar month. If #<Client># does not meet this SLA requirement while the Consumer succeeds in meeting its SLA obligations, the Consumer will be eligible to receive Financial Credits as compensation. This SLA states the Consumer's exclusive right to compensation for any failure on part to fulfill the SLA requirements.

====	Definitions
The following definitions are to be applied to SLA:

"Unavailability' is defined as the entirety of the Consumer's running instances as having no external connectivity for a duration that is at least five consecutive minutes in length, during which the Consumer is unable to launch commands against the remote API through either the Web application or Web service API.

"Downtime Period" is defined as a period of five or more consecutive minutes of the service remaining in a state of Unavailability. Periods of "Intermittent Downtime" that are less than five minutes long do not count towards Downtime Periods.

===	Quality Attribute Scenario
A Quality Attribute Scenario is an unambiguous and testable requirement for one or more Solution Quality Attributes such as Performance, Usability, Maintainability, and others. The scenario consists of six parts: Source of Stimulus, Stimulus, Environment, Artifact, Response, testable and accurate Response Measure.

This section lists and prioritizes the scenarios pertinent to the designed solution.

===	Solution Background
This section provides a description of why architecture is the way that it is, and a convincing argument that architecture is the right one to satisfy the behavioral and quality attribute goals levied upon it.

====	Architectural Approaches
This section provides a rationale for the major design decisions embodied by the software architecture. It describes any design approaches applied to software architecture, including the use of architectural styles or design patterns, when the scope of those approaches transcends any single architectural view. The section also provides a rationale for the selection of those approaches. It also describes any significant alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were ultimately rejected. The section describes any relevant COTS issues, including any associated trade studies.

====	Analysis Results
This section describes the results of any quantitative or qualitative analyses that have been performed that provide evidence that the software architecture is fit for purpose. If an Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method evaluation has been performed, it is included in the analysis sections of its final report. This section refers to the results of any other relevant trade studies, quantitative modeling, or other analysis results.

====	Requirements Coverage
This section describes the requirements (original or derived) addressed by the software architecture, with a short statement about where in the architecture each requirement is addressed.


====	Summary of Background Changes Reflected in Current Version
For versions of the SAD after the original release, this section summarizes the actions, decisions, decision drivers, analysis and trade study results that became decision drivers, requirements change that became decision drivers, and how these decisions have caused the architecture to evolve or change.

===	Product Line Reuse Considerations
//This is like there are companies who have more than one product, e.g. Microsoft. Google etc. I know this concept is usually applicable with large enterprise having more than one product.

When a software product line is being developed, this section details how the software covered by this SAD is planned or expected to be reused in order to support the product line vision. In particular, this section includes a complete list of the variations that are planned to be produced and supported. "Variation" refers to a variant of the software produced through the use of pre-planned variation mechanisms made available in the software architecture. It may refer to a variant of one of the modules identified in this SAD, or a collection of modules, or the entire system or subsystem covered by this SAD. For each variation, the section identifies the increment(s) of the software build in which (a) the variation will be available; and (b) the variation will be used. Finally, this section describes any additional potential that exists to reuse one or more of the modules or their identified variations, even if this reuse is not currently planned for any increment.

#<if none, say "Not applicable.">#


==	Architecture Description
This section contains the views of the software architecture. A view is a representation of an entire system from the perspective of a related set of concerns [IEEE 14711. Concretely, a view shows a particular type of software architectural elements that occur in a system, their properties, and the relations among them.

===	Relations Among Views
Each of the views provides a different perspective and design handle on a system, and each is valid and useful in its own right. Although the views give different system perspectives, they are not independent. Elements of one view will be related to elements of other views, and we need to reason about these relations. For example, a module in a decomposition view may be manifested as one, part of one, or several components in one of the component-and-connector views, reflecting its runtime altarage. In general, mappings between views are many to many. This section describes the relations that exist among the views given in Architecture Views.

====	General Relations Among Views
This section describes the general relationship among the views chosen to represent the architecture. Also, in this section, consistency among those views is discussed and any known inconsistencies are identified.

====	View-to-View Relations
For each set of views related to each other, this section shows how the elements in one view are related to elements in another.

===	Technology Stack
The section selects the tools, frameworks, libraries, external services, and other technologies the solution implementation will rely on.

==	Operation Plan
Typically, each service has two key phases of its lifecycle: Transition Phase and Operation Phase.

.service lifecycle
image::images/image-2023-01-16-20-12-42-799.png[width=700]

The state where the solution stays in active development mode is called *Transition Phase.* During this period main activities related to Infrastructure management will be performed by the system engineering team, especially by Configuration Managers (CMs). Their goal is to implement all technical solutions to make the product ready to enter the Operation Phase.



The transition Phase ends up with the Production Release.



The operations team will be responsible for performing the activities during the *Operation Phase*. The key goal at this phase is to maintain the desired quality of service and Service Level Agreement.
