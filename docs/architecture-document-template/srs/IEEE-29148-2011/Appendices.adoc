=== Assumptions and dependencies

List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the software but any changes to these factors can affect the requirements in the SRS. For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.

=== Acronyms and abbreviations

Spell out or define all acronyms and abbreviations used in the documents.
