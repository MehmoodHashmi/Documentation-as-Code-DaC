* **Latency, Throughput, and Related Concepts**

** Latency
*** Definition: The time delay between the initiation of a request and the response to that request
*** Examples:
**** Network latency: delay caused by network transmission time
**** Memory latency: delay caused by accessing data in memory
*** Factors affecting latency:
**** Distance between components
**** Speed of light
***** Grady Booch: told that you can't transfer (send) data faster than the speed of light, this limitation is law of physics
**** Processing time
*** Ways to reduce latency:
**** Caching
**** Load balancing
**** Compression
**** Minimizing distance
**** Reducing processing time

** Throughput
*** Definition: The amount of work performed in a given period of time
*** Examples:
**** Network throughput: the amount of data transferred over a network in a given time period
**** Disk throughput: the amount of data read/written from a disk in a given time period
*** Factors affecting throughput:
**** Bandwidth
**** Number of parallel operations
**** Processing time
*** Ways to increase throughput:
**** Parallel processing
**** Compression
**** Data prefetching
**** Optimized algorithms
**** Distributed computing

** Bandwidth
*** Definition: The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a communication channel in a given period of time
*** Examples:
**** Network bandwidth: maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given time period
**** Memory bandwidth: maximum amount of data that can be transferred from memory to the processor in a given time period
*** Factors affecting bandwidth:
**** Physical properties of the medium
**** Encoding techniques
**** Transmission protocols
*** Ways to increase bandwidth:
**** Increase physical bandwidth (e.g., using fiber optics)
**** Use efficient encoding techniques (e.g., compression)
**** Use efficient transmission protocols (e.g., TCP/IP)

** Pipelining
*** Definition: Breaking down a task into smaller stages and processing these stages in parallel
*** Examples:
**** Instruction pipelining: breaking down instruction processing into stages and executing them in parallel
**** Data pipelining: breaking down data processing into stages and processing them in parallel
*** Advantages of pipelining:
**** Faster processing of tasks
**** Increased throughput
*** Disadvantages of pipelining:
**** Increased latency due to stage processing time
**** Difficult to optimize for parallelism

** Parallelism
*** Definition: Performing multiple operations at the same time
*** Examples:
**** Multi-core processors: multiple processors on the same chip
**** GPU: specialized hardware for parallel processing of graphics
*** Advantages of parallelism:
**** Increased throughput
**** Faster processing of tasks
*** Disadvantages of parallelism:
**** Increased power consumption
**** Increased complexity of software design

** Cache
*** Definition: A small, fast memory used to store frequently accessed data
*** Examples:
**** CPU cache: a small, fast memory used to store frequently accessed data by the processor
**** Web cache: a small, fast memory used to store frequently accessed web pages
*** Advantages of cache:
**** Reduced latency for frequently accessed data
**** Increased throughput
*** Disadvantages of cache:
**** Limited size
**** Inefficient for infrequently accessed data

** Virtual Memory
*** Definition: A technique for utilizing more memory than is physically available
*** Examples:
**** Page file: A file on disk used to store portions of memory that are not currently in use
**** Memory-mapped files: A technique for mapping a file on disk to memory
*** Advantages of virtual memory:
**** Increased memory availability
**** Isolation of processes
*** Disadvantages of virtual memory:
**** Increased latency due to disk access
**** Increased complexity of memory management

** Compression
*** Definition: Reducing the size of data
*** Examples:
**** Lossless compression: reducing the size of data without losing any information
**** Lossy compression: reducing the size of data by removing some information
*** Advantages of compression:
**** Reduced storage space
**** Reduced bandwidth requirements
*** Disadvantages of compression:
**** Increased processing time
**** Reduced data quality in case of lossy compression


** Fault Tolerance
*** Definition: The ability of a system to continue functioning in the presence of failures
*** Examples:
**** Redundant hardware: having multiple copies of hardware components to take over if one fails
**** RAID: A technique for storing data across multiple disks to provide redundancy
*** Advantages of fault tolerance:
**** Increased reliability
**** Reduced downtime
*** Disadvantages of fault tolerance:
**** Increased cost

** Scheduling
*** Definition: The process of deciding which task to execute next
*** Examples:
**** Process scheduling: deciding which process to run next in a multi-tasking operating system
**** Disk scheduling: deciding which disk access request to service next
*** Factors affecting scheduling:
**** Priority of tasks
**** Resource utilization
**** Fairness
*** Types of scheduling algorithms:
**** Round-robin scheduling
**** Priority scheduling
**** First-come, first-served scheduling

** Memory Hierarchy
*** Definition: A hierarchy of storage devices, from fastest and smallest to slowest and largest
*** Examples:
**** Cache
**** Main memory (RAM)
**** Secondary storage (disk)
*** Advantages of memory hierarchy:
**** Reduced latency for frequently accessed data
**** Increased memory capacity
*** Disadvantages of memory hierarchy:
**** Increased cost
**** Complexity of memory management

** Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
*** Definition: The set of instructions that a processor can execute
*** Examples:
**** x86-64: the instruction set used by most modern desktop and server processors
**** ARM: the instruction set used by most mobile and embedded processors
*** Advantages of ISA:
**** Portability of software
**** Compatibility with existing software
*** Disadvantages of ISA:
**** Limited by the design of the ISA
**** Difficult to change once established
*** Factors affecting ISA:
**** Application requirements
**** Design constraints
**** Performance goals
*** Ways to optimize ISA:
**** Reducing the number of instructions required for a task
**** Optimizing instruction encoding
**** Adding specialized instructions for frequently used tasks

** Microarchitecture
*** Definition: The implementation of an ISA in hardware
*** Examples:
**** Intel Core microarchitecture: used in many modern desktop and server processors
**** ARM Cortex-A microarchitecture: used in many mobile and embedded processors
*** Advantages of microarchitecture:
**** Performance optimizations specific to the ISA
**** Flexibility to change design without changing the ISA
*** Disadvantages of microarchitecture:
**** Limited by the design of the ISA
**** Complexity of design and verification
*** Examples:
**** Lossless compression: reduces the size of data without losing any information
**** Lossy compression: reduces the size of data by discarding some information
