* **I have developed a lot of mindmaps related to AI, ML, DL, system design, databases, cloud computing, DevOps, programming languages, requirements engineering, data science, math, politics, Islam, blockchain, **\n**distributed systems, and others. Is this good or a waste of time?**

* Developing mind maps on various topics can be a good way to organize and visualize information. It can help you to connect different ideas and concepts and create a comprehensive overview of a specific topic. \nIt also helps in retaining information for a longer time.

* Moreover, having knowledge in various domains can be an advantage in your personal and professional life. It can help you to have a broader perspective on different topics and can also make you a valuable asset \nin various industries.

* However, it's also important to balance the time spent on learning new things and applying them in practical scenarios. It's crucial to prioritize your tasks and focus on the skills that align with your career goals and \naspirations. So, developing mind maps on different topics is not a waste of time if it's done with a purpose and a clear plan of how to use that knowledge.
