title This mindmap outlines the definition of algorithmic thinking, the steps involved in using this approach to solve problems, and the benefits it provides.\n Decomposition, patterns, and logical reasoning are key components of algorithmic thinking. The steps of algorithmic thinking include defining the problem, planning a solution, \nimplementing the plan, and evaluating the solution. The benefits of using algorithmic thinking include increased efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility, scalability, and creativity.
