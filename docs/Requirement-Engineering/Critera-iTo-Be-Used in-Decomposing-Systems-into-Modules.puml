* On the Criteria To Be Used in \nDecomposing Systems into Modules" \nby David Parnas, 1972
** Key takeaways
*** Module independence
**** Each module should have a well-defined and limited interface
**** Modules should be designed to minimize interaction with other modules
*** Information hiding
**** Modules should hide design decisions that are likely to change
**** Modules should hide details of other modules' implementation
*** Abstraction
**** Each module should represent a single abstraction
**** The internal workings of each module should be hidden
*** Hierarchical organization
**** The system should be decomposed into a hierarchy of modules
**** Each module should be at a level of abstraction appropriate to its function
** Benefits of modularity
*** Improved maintainability
**** Changes to one module should have minimal impact on other modules
**** Modules can be tested independently
*** Improved reusability
**** Modules can be reused in other systems or projects
**** Modules can be shared across a team or organization
*** Improved understandability
**** Modules can be understood and modified in isolation
**** The system's overall design can be more easily understood
** Challenges in achieving modularity
*** Identifying and defining module boundaries
**** Requires a thorough understanding of the system's requirements and design
**** May require iterations and adjustments as the system evolves
*** Managing dependencies between modules
**** Changes to one module can impact many others
**** Requires careful design and maintenance of module interfaces
*** Balancing modularity with performance and efficiency
**** Modular systems may require more overhead than monolithic ones
**** May require careful consideration of performance-critical modules
** Conclusion
*** Modularity is an important principle for software design
*** Requires careful consideration of module boundaries, information hiding, abstraction, and hierarchy
*** Benefits include improved maintainability, reusability, and understandability
