title =__APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)__

* **Definition:** a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications
** Allows different software applications to communicate with each other
** Facilitates communication between different systems and applications

* Types of APIs
** Web APIs
*** Communicate over the internet using HTTP(S) requests and responses
*** RESTful APIs are a type of web API that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manipulate resources
** Library APIs
*** A set of functions and procedures that a programmer can call to perform a specific task
*** Often packaged as a software library
** Operating System APIs
*** Expose low-level functionality of an operating system to applications
*** Examples include the Windows API and POSIX API
** Hardware APIs
*** Allow developers to interact with hardware components of a system
*** Examples include graphics card APIs, audio APIs, and camera APIs

* API Integration
** Process of connecting different software applications through their APIs
** Allows for data exchange and cross-functionality between different systems
** Commonly used in web development, mobile app development, and enterprise software integration

* API Design
** Key considerations:
*** **Functionality:** what the API will allow users to do
*** **Ease of use:** how easy it is for developers to use and integrate the API
*** **Scalability:** the ability of the API to handle increased usage and traffic
*** **Security:** ensuring that the API is secure and protected against unauthorized access and malicious attacks
** API documentation is essential for developers to understand how to use the API effectively

* API Management
** Process of managing APIs throughout their lifecycle
** Includes tasks such as API testing, versioning, documentation, security, and performance monitoring
** API gateways and API management platforms are commonly used tools for managing APIs

* API Standards and Protocols
** Standards and protocols ensure that APIs can communicate and work together effectively
**[#pink] **Examples include:**
*** **OpenAPI **(formerly Swagger), a standard for documenting RESTful APIs
*** **SOAP,** a protocol for exchanging XML-based messages over the internet
*** **JSON **(JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data interchange format
*** **OAuth,** a protocol for authentication and authorization between applications
