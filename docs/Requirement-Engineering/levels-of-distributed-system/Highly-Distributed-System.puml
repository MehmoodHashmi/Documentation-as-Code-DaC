title =__Highly Distributed System__

* Definition
**_ A system that consists of many interconnected components spread across multiple locations
**_ Designed to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads

* Characteristics
** Decentralized architecture
***_ No single point of control or failure
** Autonomous components
***_ Each component can operate independently and make decisions on its own
** Asynchronous communication
***_ Components communicate through message passing and may not require immediate response
** Scalability
***_ Designed to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads
** Fault tolerance
***_ Designed to continue operating in the face of component failures or network disruptions

* Design Considerations
** Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
*** Components are designed as services that expose well-defined interfaces
*** Promotes loose coupling and interoperability between components
** Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
*** Components communicate through events that trigger actions
*** Allows components to react to changes in real-time
** Microservices Architecture
*** Components are designed as independent microservices that can be deployed and scaled independently
*** Promotes modular design and flexibility
** Distributed Data Management
*** Data is stored and managed across multiple locations
*** May use techniques like sharding, replication, or partitioning

* Challenges
** Complexity
***_ Designing and maintaining a highly distributed system can be complex and challenging
** Latency
***_ Asynchronous communication and message passing can introduce latency
** Consistency
***_ Maintaining consistency across distributed components can be difficult
** Security
***_ Securing a highly distributed system can be challenging

* Best Practices
**_ Use established architectural patterns and design principles
**_ Implement proper monitoring and error handling mechanisms
**_ Ensure proper data management and consistency across components
**_ Secure the system through authentication, authorization, and encryption
**_ Test and validate the system thoroughly before deployment
