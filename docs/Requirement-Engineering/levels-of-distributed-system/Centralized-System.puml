** Users access the system through remote terminals or devices

* Characteristics
** Centralized control of resources and data
** Single point of failure
** Limited scalability
** Potential for network congestion
** Lower hardware and maintenance costs

* Types of Centralized Systems
** Mainframe Systems
*** Used for large-scale computing tasks
*** Highly reliable and secure
*** Require specialized skills and resources to operate and maintain
** Client-Server Systems
*** Consist of a central server and multiple clients
*** Clients request resources and services from the server
