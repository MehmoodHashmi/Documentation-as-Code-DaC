title =__ Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)__
* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
** Definition
*** A directed graph with no directed cycles
** Characteristics
*** Consists of nodes and directed edges
*** Nodes represent tasks or operations
*** Edges represent dependencies between tasks
*** No circular dependencies are allowed
** Applications
*** Data pipeline design and orchestration
*** Task scheduling and dependency management
*** Workflow management systems
** Benefits
*** Enables parallel execution of independent tasks
*** Provides clear visualization of task dependencies
*** Facilitates efficient task scheduling and optimization
*** Supports fault-tolerance and error handling
** Use Cases
*** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
*** Batch processing workflows
*** Machine learning pipelines
*** Event-driven architectures
** Examples
*** Apache Airflow
*** Luigi
*** Apache NiFi
*** Apache Beam
** Best Practices
*** Identify task dependencies and define the DAG structure
*** Ensure there are no circular dependencies
*** Optimize task execution order for efficiency
*** Handle error and failure scenarios gracefully
*** Monitor and track task progress and dependencies
