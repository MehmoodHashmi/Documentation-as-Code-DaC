** Overview
*** Distributed processing framework
*** Designed for handling large-scale data processing
*** Provides scalability, fault tolerance, and reliability
**[#pink] Core Components
*** Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
**** Distributed file system for storing data across multiple machines
**** Provides high throughput data access and fault tolerance
*** MapReduce
**** Programming model for processing large datasets in parallel
**** Splits data into smaller chunks and processes them in parallel
*** YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
**** Resource management framework for scheduling and managing tasks
**** Enables efficient resource allocation and job coordination
**[#pink] **Ecosystem** \n<img:images/img_7.png>
*** Hadoop Common
