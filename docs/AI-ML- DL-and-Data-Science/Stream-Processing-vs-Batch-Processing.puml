* Stream Processing vs. Batch Processing
** Stream Processing
*** Definition
**** Stream processing refers to the real-time processing of continuous data streams, analyzing and acting on data as it is generated.
*** Key Characteristics
**** Continuous and Real-time
**** Infinite Data Streams
**** Event-driven Processing
**** Low Latency
**** Stateless and Parallel Processing
*** Use Cases
**** Real-time Analytics
**** Fraud Detection
**** IoT Data Processing
**** Clickstream Analysis
**** Monitoring and Alerting
*** Technologies
**** Apache Kafka
**** Apache Flink
**** Apache Storm
**** Spark Streaming
**** Amazon Kinesis
** Batch Processing
*** Definition
**** Batch processing refers to processing large volumes of data in discrete batches, analyzing and acting on data in fixed intervals or predefined time windows.
*** Key Characteristics
**** Bulk Processing
**** Finite Data Sets
**** Scheduled Processing
**** High Throughput
**** Stateful and Sequential Processing
*** Use Cases
**** Data Warehousing
**** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes
**** Business Intelligence Reporting
**** Data Aggregation
**** Data Archiving and Backup
*** Technologies
**** Apache Hadoop
**** Apache Spark
**** Apache Hive
**** Apache Pig
**** Amazon EMR
** Considerations for Choosing Between Stream and Batch Processing
*** Data Freshness Requirements
*** Processing Latency
*** Data Volume and Velocity
*** Processing Complexity
*** Use Case and Application Requirements
*** Scalability and Resource Utilization
** Hybrid Solutions: Lambda Architecture
*** Definition
**** Lambda architecture combines both stream and batch processing approaches to handle real-time and historical data processing.
*** Advantages
**** Real-time and Historical Insights
**** Fault Tolerance and Resilience
**** Flexible and Extensible Architecture
**** Polyglot Persistence
**** Separation of Concerns
*** Challenges
**** Complexity and Maintenance
**** Data Consistency and Synchronization
**** Development and Deployment Overhead
**** Data Duplication and Storage Costs
**** Skill and Expertise Requirements
