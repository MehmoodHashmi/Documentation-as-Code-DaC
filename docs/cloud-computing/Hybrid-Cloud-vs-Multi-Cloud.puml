* Hybrid Cloud vs. Multi-Cloud
** Hybrid Cloud
*** Combination of public and private cloud infrastructure.
*** Integrates on-premises resources with cloud services.
*** Provides flexibility, scalability, and data sovereignty.
*** Offers a balance between security and cost-effectiveness.
*** Enables workload portability and data control.
** Multi-Cloud
*** Utilizes multiple cloud service providers (CSPs).
*** Distributes workloads across different cloud environments.
*** Reduces vendor lock-in and increases redundancy.
*** Allows for best-of-breed service selection.
*** Enhances application performance and availability.
** Similarities
*** Both leverage cloud computing technologies.
*** Provide flexibility and scalability for applications.
*** Offer increased data resilience and disaster recovery.
*** Enable cost optimization through resource allocation.
*** Require robust network connectivity and integration.
** Differences
*** Hybrid cloud combines private and public infrastructure, while multi-cloud uses multiple CSPs.
*** Hybrid cloud emphasizes integration and control, while multi-cloud focuses on service diversity.
*** Hybrid cloud enables data sovereignty and compliance, while multi-cloud enhances redundancy and availability.
*** Hybrid cloud requires more complex management and integration, while multi-cloud requires service orchestration.
