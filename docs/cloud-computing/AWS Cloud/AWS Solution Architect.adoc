* when you stop an ebs backed ec2 instance

* ec2 instance termination
* ec2 instance metadata
* ec2 instance user data
* ec2 bare metal instances
* ec2 instance storage (*DAS* or direct attach storage) and elastic block storage (*NAT* or network attach storage)

** DAS is faster while NAT is slower

== What is VPC and how it works | Types of VPC -1
max 5-vpc and max 200 subnets can be created in one vpc. 5-vpc in one aws-account. You can submit a request to the aws if you need more than 5-vpc.

*once a vpc is created then DHCP, NACL and security groups will be created automatically.*

== What is VPC and how it works | Types of VPC -2

.*2-Types of VPC*
. *Default VPC:* default internet gateway is available hence can communicate to internet

. *Custom VPC:* default internet gateway is not available hence cannot communicate to internet. but you can create internet gateway and talk to internet.

.*IPs* which you cannot use in your *VPC*

.*4-most important steps in creating VPC*
. create a *VPC*
. create *subnet*
** *public subnet:* connected to *#internet gateway#* hence can communicate to #internet#
** *private subnet:* is not connected to *#internet gateway#* hence cannot communicate to #internet#.
** *CIDR block range* can be only between 16-28 (actual is 0-31)
. create *internet gateway*
. create *route table*

.History of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam (SAA-C03)
https://tutorialsdojo.com/whats-new-with-the-saa-c03-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-exam-this-2022/

https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course

The focus for most of the exam was S3 hands down. There was a lot that focused on Storage Classes and Lifecycle policies. There were a few on VPC's, Load Balancing, but the thing to remember is the 5 pillars: #Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization# because regardless of the question, it always comes down to these 5 things. The question will ask *_MOST cost-efficient, or FASTEST to transfer_*. Take this into consideration when determining your answer.
