:toc-title: Technology Agnostic Cloud Computing
:doctype: book

I work as a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, and I help our customers build applications using the Azure Cloud.
So I'm going to guess that a Cloud Solution Architect does a lot of architecture.
Yes, you are right, Actually this is a word which is always confusing because it means different things to different people,
absolutely yeah, it can be basic for some people, or it can be a larger enterprise in nature.
So, when you do architecture, what do you mean by architecture?
Okay for me, it is helping customers understand what are the pieces they have today & they can bring in new technologies that we are offering in the cloud, how to make those things work interchangeably, so when people have an application that may exist today, they may say we want to Azure, but we do not know how to make those pieces fit with technologies that Microsoft had offered.
So we use visual tools like whiteboard,
discussion or presentation to help customers understand what is an actual road map.
Some people have existing applications that they want to migrate & some people are doing green field kind of deployment.
they ask how we best align the way
people are building applications today instead of doing it the way they were doing it 10-years ago
& then again updating it.

*Server-less* is an even advanced concept:

NOTE: *Container image:../3-devops/images/docker.svg[width=40]* #---># *_Kubernetes_* #---># *_server-less_* #---># *(Future ?)*

*_##Server-less [.underline]#the program# does auto-scaling (vertically & horizontally)##_*

*Serverless computing* is a *cloud computing model* which enables *developers* to build and run applications without the need to manage or provision servers. Some key attributes of serverless computing are *#scalability, cost efficiency, flexibility, and simplified development and deployment.#* It offers a pay-as-you-go model, allowing developers to only pay for the resources they use, and it also offers *near-instant scalability, allowing applications to scale up and down automatically as needed*. Additionally, serverless computing eliminates the need to manage server infrastructure, as all the servers are managed by the cloud provider, and makes development and deployment simpler and faster.

.*_How PaaS, IaaS, SaaS, CaaS & FaaS (Server-less) are separated at service level_* In this section, we are going to learn about how we can separate *_##IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS##_* at the service level:

image:images/supporting_layers_by_vendors.png[]

As the previous diagram suggests, we have the first column as *OPS*, which stands for *operations*. [.underline]#That means the bare minimum requirement for any typical server. When we are going with a server to buy, we should consider the preceding features before buying.#

*_##It includes Application, Data, Runtime, Framework, Operating System, Server, Disk, and Network Stack.##_*

When we move to cloud and decide to go with #*IaaS*#—in this case we are not bothered about *server, disk, and network stack*. Thus, the headache of handling hardware part is no more with us. That's why it is called Infrastructure as a Service.

Now if we think of *#PaaS#*, we should not be worried about *runtime, framework, and operating system* along with the components in IaaS. Things that we need to focus on are only application and data.

And the last deployment model is *SaaS—Software* as a Service. In this model we are not concerned about literally anything. The only thing that we need to work on is the code and just a look at the bill. It's that simple!

== Phases of Cloud Adoption

. https://rescale.com/blog/cloud-3-0-the-rise-of-big-compute/[*_Cloud 1.0 ---is-> SaaS, Cloud 2.0 ---is-> Big Data, Cloud 3.0 ---is-> Big #Compute_#*]
    ** *Cloud 1.0:* SaaS (In this model we are not concerned about literally anything. The only thing that we need to work on is the *code* and just a look at the *bill*.)
    ** *Cloud 2.0:* Big Data (removed constraints on *#data#* and transformed major enterprise software categories)
    ** *Cloud 3.0:* Big Compute (eliminates constraints on *#compute hardware#* and provides the ability to scale computational workloads seamlessly on workload-optimized infrastructure configurations without sacrificing performance.)

image::images/image-2023-02-16-22-22-46-029.png[]

When your *software architecture* is about *microservices*, then *containers* are a good choice. When you are using old *monolithic applications* then *VMs* are not a bad option. So it always depends on the context what you need to learn specifically. The topic is rather broad to summarize it. A book might help with that, but sadly I cannot suggest a good broad one. "Kubernetes in Action" gives you a good start in Kubernetes though.

*#Cloud applications#* are fundamentally different than #traditional applications# that run on the *desktop, in a browser, or on a mobile device*. This master class from Wintellect cofounder and Microsoft Software Architect Jeffrey Richter offers a deep dive into cloud architecture that is independent of platform. Whether you are designing applications for Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or other cloud platforms, watching this series — and absorbing the principles contained therein — is a MUST before writing the first line of code.

<1> What is *orchestration vs automation*?

* *Automation* refers to automating a single process or a small number of related tasks, (e.g., deploying an app).
* *Orchestration* refers to managing multiple automated tasks to create a dynamic workflow (e.g., deploying an app, connecting it to a network, and integrating it with other systems).
<2> The purpose of an *Orchestrator*:

Infrastructure/PIatform/Containers/Functions as a Service
(aka Orchestrators)

• Manage a cluster's (set of PC/VMs) lifecycle, networking,
health, upgrades, scaling, & deploys/runs service code.

== Networking Communication

=== Description
Microservices use networking to communicate with each other, but architecting a robust microservice-based application is not as simple as replacing function calls with network calls. In this session, Jeffrey introduces important concepts such as API versioning, client retries, and idempotence, and explains why they are critical to distributed cloud architectures.

=== Description
*_Queues_* are used to facilitate reliable message-based communication between services. Learn what queues are, why messaging communication with queues is frequently preferable to networking communication, and what implications queues have for the design and implementation of distributed cloud applications.
