So BRDs are prepared in such a way that anyone can refer to the document for easy reference. No technical jargon is used, and the business requirements are put down in laymanâ€™s terms to avoid confusion. However, a BRD is not the ideal document for the technical development team to understand the system thoroughly. Hence, a Functional Specification document is there to meet the requirements of the development team.

While a BRD discusses what needs to be done or achieved in a particular project, FRS focuses on how the team should complete the project & how should the system behave to find the best path to complete the project within the stipulated time. The Functional Specification Document also defines the intended behavior of a system, including data, operations, input, output, and the properties of the system. FRD is more insightful and intended for the development and testing team to fulfill their job in a particular project.
