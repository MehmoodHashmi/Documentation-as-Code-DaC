** Layers of the Earth
*** Inner Core
**** Solid iron-nickel alloy
**** Temperature: ~5,200°C
*** Outer Core
**** Molten iron-nickel alloy
**** Generates Earth's magnetic field
**** Temperature: ~4,000-5,000°C
*** Mantle
**** Mostly solid rock
**** Contains magma which rises to the surface through volcanoes
**** Temperature: ~1,000-3,700°C
*** Crust
**** Thin, solid outer layer
**** Divided into tectonic plates
**** Composed of various rocks and minerals
**** Average thickness: 40 km

**** Contains the majority of the Earth's air mass
**** Site of weather phenomena
*** Stratosphere
**** Contains the ozone layer which absorbs harmful UV radiation from the Sun
**** Site of jet streams which affect weather patterns
*** Mesosphere
**** Protects the Earth from meteoroids which burn up upon entry
**** Site of noctilucent clouds

** Hydrosphere
*** Oceans
**** Covers ~71% of Earth's surface
**** Composed of saltwater
**** Site of various marine life forms
*** Rivers and Lakes
**** Freshwater sources
**** Important for agriculture and human consumption
** Earth's Magnetic Field
*** Generated by the outer core
*** Protects the Earth from solar wind and cosmic radiation
*** Allows for the formation of auroras
