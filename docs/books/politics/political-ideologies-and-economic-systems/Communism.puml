* Communism
** Definition
***:**Communism** is actually a variation on top of fascism, it also has no regard for the individual, it thinks more in terms of **class (A, B, C, etc.)** it's not so much about the nation which is in the center in fascism it is the class to
which you belong to is at the center. And hero of communism is not the nation it's the working **class (A, B, C, etc.)**
= In communist society you don't get freedom to choose your profession. The communist party tells you that you now go to the farm to raise cabbages,
=and he now goes to the factory to produce cars, and we will tell you how many cabbages to produce, and what kind of car to produce.
So you don't 've the liberty to choose your profession if you were born to a peasant family you will be peasant. If your father was a cobbler, you will be a cobbler that's it you don't have 've any choice there.
And when it comes to choosing your spouse its same thing it doesn't matter to whom you love. What matters is what your elders tell you what your church/mosque/molvi tells you and what the nation needs to.
