title This mindmap is organized into five main branches based on geographic regions: Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. Each branch contains sub-branches for individual countries in that region. \nThe West Asia branch also includes a sub-branch for Israel and Palestine, as these countries are often grouped together in discussions of regional politics.
