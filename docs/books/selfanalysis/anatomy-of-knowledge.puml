*[#darkblue] =<i>Anatomy of knowledge\n<img:img.png>
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Smallest unit of "knowledge"?
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>is "concept"
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>e.g. bit in computer hardware, cell in human body, atom in of matter
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Concept is a single unit
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Types of Concepts
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Concrete Concepts
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Tangible, directly observable entities <b>(e.g., Chair, Tree).
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Abstract Concepts
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Intangible, theoretical, or philosophical ideas <b>(e.g., Justice, Love).
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Correlational Concepts
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>The correlation between two **concepts** is <b>"proposition"
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>e.g. the semantic or logical relationship between two concepts or entities
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Schema
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>The place where these "proposition" exist in brain is called "schema"
****[#yellow]:*<i><color #black><size:14>e.g. the schema of a person
*<i><color #black><size:14>e.g. the schema of a book
*<i><color #black><size:14>e.g. the schema of a city
*<i><color #black><size:14>e.g. the schema of a country etc.;
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>The "knowledge" you absorb can be
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Sementic
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>means names and places
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Episodic
****[#yellow]:<i><color #black><size:14>Episodic memory is the memory of everyday events that can be explicitly stated or conjured.
<i><color #black><size:14>It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred at particular times and places; for
<i><color #black><size:14>example, the party on one's 7th birthday.;
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Types of "knowledge"
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Procedural "knowledge"
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>The utility of procedural knowledge enables you to do things
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>"Outcome" of "procedural" knowledge is "conditional" knowledge
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Incomplete without "Conditional knowledge"
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Conditional "knowledge"
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>is the break, when don't do something, gives you precision
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_598.png Explicit "knowledge"]]
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Some sort of "knowledge" you carry & can explain it then its explicit "knowledge"
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_598.png Implicit "knowledge"]]
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Some sort of "knowledge" that you carry but can't explain it then its implicit "knowledge"

****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>10-year boy throwing & swinging the ball but can't explain why it is swinging
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>How to become master?
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>When you 've the ability to make the implicit knowledge explicit
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Now you can transfer "knowledge" to somebody
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Parts of "knowledge"
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Cognition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Discusses theory
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Psychomotor
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Working manually
***[#a] <b><i><color #white><size:14>[[docs/1-business-analyst/client-management/software-house/images/img_2.png Attitude]]
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>To use **cognition & psychomotor** affectively you need <b>"attitude"
****[#a] <b><i><color #black><size:14>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_285.png Attitude can't be learned verbally]]
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Behavioral part
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Cannot be learned without a <b>"role model"

**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Formation of Concepts
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Induction
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Formed by observing specific instances and extracting commonalities.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Deduction
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Derived from general principles or categories to specific instances.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Role in Cognition
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Understanding and Learning
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Concepts** aid comprehension and acquisition of knowledge.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Problem-Solving
