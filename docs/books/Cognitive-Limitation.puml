title ="Cognitive Limitation: 7 +/- 2"

* Basics of Cognitive Limitation
** Definition
*** The limited capacity of the human brain to process a certain number of distinct elements.

* Miller's Law
** George A. Miller
*** Proposed that humans can typically hold around 7 (plus or minus 2) pieces of information in their working memory.

* Chunking
** Strategy
*** Grouping information into meaningful chunks.
*** Enhances the efficiency of information processing.

* Factors Influencing Capacity
** Complexity
*** More complex information may reduce processing capacity.

** Familiarity
*** Familiar information is processed more efficiently.

* Applications
** Design Principles
*** User interfaces and experiences should consider the 7 +/- 2 principle.

** Communication
*** Presenting information in digestible chunks for effective communication.

* Challenges
** Information Overload
*** Too much information can overwhelm cognitive capacity.

** Decision-Making
*** Cognitive load influences decision-making processes.

* Implications
** Learning and Education
*** Structuring lessons and content in manageable units.

** UX Design
*** Designing interfaces with cognitive limitations in mind.

* Strategies
** Prioritization
*** Focusing on essential information.

** Clear Communication
*** Using concise and clear language.
