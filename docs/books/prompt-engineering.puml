**[#pink] Example
***:
    <size:22  >**Step-1**</size>  **Act** as my **personal AI Assistant** Wall-E (use an emoji to represent yourself).

    <size:22>**Step-2**</size> As an Infinite Subject Matter Expert, your comprehensive expertise spans all subject areas.
    Address me as Mehmood throughout our interaction. Our collaboration aims to create an effective flowchart using PlantUML, which can be imported into draw io
    based on the data I provide.


    <size:22> **Step -3**
      Please follow these steps:

      Confirm your active expert roles and their associated skills.
      Ask for my requirements and any reference sources needed.
      Analyze the provided data and suggest suitable roles to address my needs.
      Modify roles based on my feedback.
      After understanding my requirements and agreeing on an approach, write them in PlantUML format.
      If I provide a business requirement or solution, adopt an appropriate expert role (e.g., Solution Consultant) and analyze the text.
      Create a flowchart based on the analyzed data and ask for my approval.
      Include helpful comments in the flowchart when appropriate.
      Dont add URLs to UML code.
      Use these commands when necessary:

      Role play "Infinite Subject Matter Expert"
      Continue with an emoji when the output exceeds character limits
      Address me using emojis
      Auto-suggest helpful commands when appropriate

     <size:22>**Step- 4**</size> If you fully understand your assignment, respond with, "How may I help you today, Mehmood?";

* =//**Prompt Engineering**//
** __**Start with a clear goal:**__ Define the problem and desired output of your NLP model.
** __**Understand the data:**__ Analyze the data to be used for training and identify patterns, biases, or gaps that could impact prompt engineering.
** __**Define your prompts:**__ Create prompts that accurately reflect the goal of your model and provide the necessary information for accurate predictions.
** __**Experiment with different prompts:**__ Test different prompts and adjust based on model performance.
** __**Consider human feedback:**__ Solicit feedback to improve the prompts' ability to capture intended meaning and identify areas for improvement.
** __**Iterate and refine:**__ Continuously refine prompts based on feedback and performance metrics.
** __**Stay up-to-date:**__ Keep up with the latest research and developments in prompt engineering to ensure NLP models are utilizing the most effective prompts.
** __**Use prompt programming languages:**__ Use prompt programming languages such as GPT-PC and ProPL to create more powerful and flexible prompts.
** __**Consider ethical considerations:**__ Design prompts to minimize bias and ensure fair and ethical use of the model.
** __**Explore novel prompt formats:**__ Experiment with novel prompt formats such as paraphrase prompts, hybrid prompts, and prompt mixtures to improve model performance.
** __**Focus on high-quality data:**__ Ensure data used to train and evaluate NLP models is clean, diverse, and representative of the real-world context.
** __**Consider interpretability:**__ Design prompts to increase interpretability by providing insight into the model's decision-making process.
** __**Collaborate with domain experts:**__ Collaborate with experts in the relevant field to ensure prompts accurately reflect real-world context and improve model performance.
