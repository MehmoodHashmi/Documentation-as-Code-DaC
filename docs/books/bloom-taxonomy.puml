*  **Concept:**
*  **Remembering:** Ability to retain information and recall it at a later time
*  **Understanding:** involves comprehending and making sense of information, concepts, or ideas.
*  **Applying:** Using knowledge, concepts, or ideas in a practical or real-world context.
*  **Analyzing:** breaking down complex information into its component parts and examine the relationships between them. Activities at this level might include identifying patterns, comparing and contrasting information, or organizing information into categories.
*  **Evaluating:** involves the ability to make judgments about the value or quality of information, based on criteria that have been developed. Examples include evaluating the credibility of sources,  critiquing an argument, or judging the effectiveness of a strategy.
*  **Creating:** involves using knowledge and skills to produce something new or original. Activities at this level might include designing a product, composing a piece of music or writing, or creating a work of art.

* =**Bloom's Taxonomy**
**[#yellow] **Cognitive domain** is often seen as the most important domain as it is directly related to **intellectual abilities, knowledge acquisition, and critical thinking skills** that are essential for **academic and professional success**.
**[#yellow] ==**Cognitive Domain**
*** Remembering
*** Understanding
*** Applying
*** Analyzing
*** Evaluating
*** Creating
**[#yellow] The **affective and psychomotor domains** are equally important as they contribute to the **development of emotional intelligence, social skills, creativity, and physical abilities.**
**[#yellow] Fields such as **performing arts, sports, and health care** require a strong emphasis on the **affective and psychomotor domains,** as they involve the development of skills that cannot be fully acquired through **cognitive learning** alone.
**[#yellow] =**Affective Domain**
*** Receiving
*** Responding
*** Valuing
*** Organization
*** Characterization
**[#yellow] =**Psychomotor Domain**
*** Perception
*** Set
*** Guided Response
*** Mechanism
*** Complex Overt Response
*** Adaptation
*** Origination


* **Concept**
**[#yellow] **Remembering**
***[#white] **Strategies**
**** Repetition
***** Repeating information multiple times to increase the chances of remembering it
***** Effective for memorizing basic facts or information
**** Mnemonics
***** Creating memory aids to help remember information
***** Used to remember complex concepts or ideas by associating them with a memorable phrase or image
**** Chunking
***** Breaking down information into smaller, more manageable pieces
***** Used to remember longer strings of information by grouping them into smaller, more memorable chunks
**** Visualization
***** Creating mental images of concepts or ideas to aid in remembering them

**** Memory palace or method of loci
***** Associating information with different locations within a familiar environment or memory palace
***** Visualizing the information in different locations to aid in recall
**** Spaced repetition
***** Reviewing information at increasing intervals over time
***** Strengthening memory retention and making information easier to recall over a longer period
**** **Strategies:** can be used individually or in combination, improving memory retention and recall

**[#yellow] **Understanding**
***[#white] **Strategies**
