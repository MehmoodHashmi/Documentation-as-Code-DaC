* Concurrency Control Comparison: OODBMS vs RDBMS

** **Concurrency Control in RDBMS**
*** Locking-based mechanisms
**** Individual row, table, or database locks
**** Shared, exclusive, and update locks
**** Can lead to contention and deadlocks
*** Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
**** Uses snapshots of data
**** Keeps track of different versions of data for different transactions

** **Concurrency Control in OODBMS**
*** Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)
**** Allows simultaneous operations on the same object
**** Assumes no conflicts
*** Conflict Detection and Resolution
**** Version numbers, time-stamps, conflict sets
**** Rolls back one or both transactions on conflict
**** Allows transactions to retry their operations
