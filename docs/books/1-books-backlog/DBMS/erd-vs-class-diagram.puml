* ERD vs Class Diagram
** **ERD**
*** Describes data requirements and relationships in a system
*** Includes entities, attributes, and relationships
*** Does not include methods or behaviors
*** Focuses on data modeling
** **Class Diagram**
*** Describes the classes in a system and how they interact with each other
*** Includes classes, attributes, methods, and relationships
*** Focuses on object-oriented design and programming
*** Shows both data and behavior of the system

* **Steps to Convert a Class Diagram to an ERD**
** Identify the Classes
*** Determine the classes in the Class Diagram
** Define the Entities
*** Identify the nouns in the class names
*** These become the entities in the ERD
** Add Attributes
*** Identify the data elements in the class attributes
*** These become the attributes in the ERD
** Add Relationships
*** Identify the associations in the Class Diagram
*** These become the relationships in the ERD
*** Determine the cardinality and optionality of the relationships
** Normalize the ERD
*** Remove redundancies in the data model
*** Ensure data integrity and consistency
*** Apply normalization rules to improve the design
