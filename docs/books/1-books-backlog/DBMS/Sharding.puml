* Sharding
** Definition
*** Sharding is a data partitioning technique used in distributed databases to horizontally scale data storage and improve performance.
**[#pink] **Key Concepts**
*** Data Partitioning
**** Dividing data into smaller subsets called shards or partitions.
**** Each shard contains a subset of data based on a predefined partitioning strategy.
*** Distributed Storage
**** Storing shards across multiple machines or nodes in a distributed manner.
**** Each machine/node is responsible for managing a subset of the data.
*** Scalability
**** Enables scaling horizontally by adding more machines/nodes to handle increased data load and traffic.
**** Allows distributing the workload across multiple machines/nodes for better performance.
** Benefits
*** Improved Performance
**** Distributing data across multiple machines/nodes allows parallel processing and reduces the load on individual resources.
**** Queries and operations can be executed in parallel, leading to faster response times.
*** Horizontal Scalability
**** Sharding enables adding more machines/nodes to the system as the data grows, allowing seamless scaling without downtime.
**** Each machine/node can handle a subset of the data, ensuring efficient utilization of resources.
*** Fault Tolerance
**** Sharding provides fault tolerance by replicating data shards across multiple machines/nodes.
**** If one machine/node fails, the data can still be accessed and served from other available machines/nodes.
** Sharding Strategies
*** Range-Based Sharding
**** Data is partitioned based on a specific range of values (e.g., customer ID, date range).
**** Each shard manages a specific range of values, and queries targeting a specific range can be directed to the corresponding shard.
*** Hash-Based Sharding
**** Data is partitioned based on a hash function applied to a specific key (e.g., user ID, product ID).
**** The hash function determines the shard where the data should be stored, allowing for even distribution across shards.
*** Directory-Based Sharding
**** A centralized directory or metadata service maintains the mapping of data to shards.
**** The directory helps route queries to the appropriate shard by keeping track of the shard locations for each data item.
** Considerations and Challenges
*** Data Consistency
**** Maintaining consistency across multiple shards can be challenging due to distributed nature.
**** Techniques like eventual consistency or distributed transactions may be used to ensure data integrity.
*** Query Routing
**** Routing queries to the correct shard based on the sharding strategy requires efficient query routing mechanisms.
**** Query routers or load balancers can be used to direct queries to the appropriate shard.
*** Data Rebalancing
**** As the data grows or the number of shards changes, data rebalancing may be necessary to ensure even distribution.
**** Moving data between shards while maintaining consistency can be a complex task.
