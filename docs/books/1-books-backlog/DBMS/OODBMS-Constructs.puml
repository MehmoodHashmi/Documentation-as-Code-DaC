title This mindmap covers the various constructs in Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS), including object identity, object classes, object attributes, object\n relationships, and object behavior. It goes into detail on each construct, such as the different types of inheritance and encapsulation, as well as the different types of object attributes, such as simple and\n complex attributes. It also covers the various types of object relationships, such as associations, compositions, and aggregations, and the different types of object behavior, such as methods, triggers, and transactions.
