*[#darkblue] <color #white><i><size:24><u>8 Fallacies of \n<i><color #white>Distributed Systems
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>1- The Network Is Reliable
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that network packets will always arrive at their destination, but in reality, **network congestion or failures** can cause packets to be lost.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>2- Latency Is Zero
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that communication between two nodes is instantaneous, but in reality, there is always some delay due to network distance, routing, and processing time.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>3- Bandwidth Is Infinite
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that it can transfer an unlimited amount of data over the network, but in reality, there are limitations on the available bandwidth that can affect performance.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>4- The Network Is Secure
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that data transmitted over the network is safe from unauthorized access or modification, but in reality, the network can be vulnerable to \n<i><size:12>attacks such as eavesdropping or data interception.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>5- Topology Doesn't Change
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that the network topology is static and unchanging, but in reality, network configurations can change due to hardware failures, \n<i><size:12>software updates, or changes in traffic patterns.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>6- There Is One Administrator
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that there is a single point of control for the entire distributed system, but in reality, there may be multiple \n<i><size:12>administrators with different levels of access and control.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>7- Transport Cost Is Zero
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that there is no cost associated with transmitting data over the network, but in reality, there may be costs such as network usage \n<i><size:12>fees or resource utilization that must be considered.
**[#lightblue] <color #black><i><size:12>8- The Network Is Homogeneous
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application** assumes that all nodes in the network have the same capabilities and operating environment, but in reality, there may be differences in \n<i><size:12>hardware, software, or network protocols that can affect compatibility and performance.
**[#gold] <color #black><i><size:12>9-
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application**
**[#gold] <color #black><i><size:12>10-
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application**
**[#gold] <color #black><i><size:12>11- Observability
***[#yellow] <i><size:12>**Example:** An **application**
