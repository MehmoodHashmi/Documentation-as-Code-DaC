title =__ ACID vs BASE__

* **ACID vs BASE**
** **ACID**
*** Definition
**** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
**** A set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of transactions.
*** Key Characteristics
**** Transactions are atomic and indivisible.
**** Transactions maintain consistency of the database.
**** Transactions are isolated from each other.
**** Transactions are durable and will persist even if the system fails.
*** Examples
**** Bank transactions
**** Flight reservation systems
** **BASE**
*** Definition
**** Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent
**** A set of properties that allow for greater scalability and availability of distributed systems.
*** Key Characteristics
**** Systems prioritize availability over consistency.
**** The system may experience temporary inconsistency but will eventually become consistent.
**** The system is designed to be adaptable to changes in workload and usage.
*** Examples
**** Social media newsfeeds
**** Recommendation systems
** Comparison
*** ACID focuses on data consistency and reliability, while BASE prioritizes availability and scalability.
*** ACID transactions are immediate and guarantee consistency, while BASE systems may experience temporary inconsistency but eventually become consistent.
*** ACID is best for systems that require high reliability and data consistency, while BASE is best for systems that require high availability and scalability.
*** ACID is commonly used for transactional systems, while BASE is commonly used for non-transactional systems.
*** ACID systems can be slower and less scalable than BASE systems.
