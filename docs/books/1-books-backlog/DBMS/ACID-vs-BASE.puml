* **ACID vs BASE**
** **ACID**
*** Definition
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of transactions.
*** Key Characteristics
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Transactions are atomic and indivisible.
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Transactions maintain consistency of the database.
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Transactions are isolated from each other.
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Transactions are durable and will persist even if the system fails.
*** Examples
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Bank transactions
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Flight reservation systems
** **BASE**
*** Definition
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A set of properties that allow for greater scalability and availability of distributed systems.
*** Key Characteristics
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Systems prioritize availability over consistency.
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>The system may experience temporary inconsistency but will eventually become consistent.
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>The system is designed to be adaptable to changes in workload and usage.
*** Examples
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Social media newsfeeds
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Recommendation systems
** Comparison
*** **ACID** focuses on data consistency and reliability, while **BASE** prioritizes availability and scalability.
*** **ACID** transactions are immediate and guarantee consistency, while **BASE** systems may experience temporary inconsistency but eventually become consistent.
*** **ACID** is best for systems that require high reliability and data consistency, while **BASE** is best for systems that require high availability and scalability.
*** **ACID** is commonly used for transactional systems, while **BASE** is commonly used for non-transactional systems.
*** **ACID** systems can be slower and less scalable than **BASE** systems.
