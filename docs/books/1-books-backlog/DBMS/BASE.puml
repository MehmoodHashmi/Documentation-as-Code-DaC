* BASE
** Definition
*** Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent
** Characteristics
*** Emphasizes availability over consistency
*** Tolerates eventual consistency instead of immediate consistency
*** Provides more flexibility and scalability
*** Is a complement to ACID, rather than a replacement
** Components
*** B - Basically Available
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Ensures availability, even when some nodes fail
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Serves incomplete data to users, instead of denying access
*** S - Soft State
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>State of the system may change over time, even without input
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Implies there may not be a consistent view of the data at all times
*** E - Eventually Consistent
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Achieves consistency over time, rather than immediately
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Data may not be consistent during the process of updates
** Example
*** A shopping cart
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>A user adds items to their cart on one node
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>Before payment, the user goes to another node
****[#yellow] ====<size:13>The user's cart is eventually consistent across both nodes
