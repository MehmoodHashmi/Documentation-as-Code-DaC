*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>BASE
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14><color #black>Definition
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14><color #black>Characteristics
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Emphasizes availability over consistency
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Tolerates eventual consistency instead of immediate consistency
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white>Provides more flexibility and scalability
***[#green] <i><size:22><color #white>Is a "complement" to **ACID,** rather than a <b>replacement
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14><color #black>Components
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white><b>B - Basically Available
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>Ensures availability, even when some nodes fail
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>Serves incomplete data to users, instead of denying access
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white><b>S - Soft State
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>State of the system may change over time, <b>even without input
****[#yellow] <i><size:18><color #black>Implies there may not be a **"consistent view"** of the **"data"** at all times
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white><b>E - Eventually Consistent
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>Achieves consistency over time, rather than immediately
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>Data may not be consistent during the process of updates
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14><color #black>Example
***[#green] <i><size:14><color #white><b>A shopping cart
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>A user adds items to their cart on one node
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>Before payment, the user goes to another node
****[#yellow] <i><size:14><color #black>The user's cart is eventually consistent across both nodes
