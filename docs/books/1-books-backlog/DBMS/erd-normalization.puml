title = __Key Takeaways from Discussion on ERD and Normalization__

* ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
** Graphical representation of entities, attributes, and relationships
** Entity is an object or concept with a unique identity
** Attributes describe the properties of an entity
** Relationship is a connection between entities
** Cardinality specifies the number of occurrences of entities related to each other

* **Normalization**
** Organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity
** Normal forms are a set of rules governing the process
***[#yellow] **First normal form (1NF)**
**** Each attribute in a table is atomic and no repeating groups or arrays
***[#yellow] **Second normal form (2NF)**
**** Each non-key attribute is functionally dependent on the primary key
***[#yellow] **Third normal form (3NF)**
**** Each non-key attribute is not transitively dependent on the primary key
***[#yellow] **Fourth normal form (4NF)**
**** No multi-valued dependencies
***[#yellow] **Fifth normal form (5NF)**
**** No join dependencies

* **Benefits of Normalization**
** Eliminates data redundancy
** Improves data consistency and accuracy
** Simplifies data maintenance and updates
** Reduces data storage space
** Provides a foundation for effective database design

* **Challenges of Normalization**
** Can be time-consuming and complex
** May result in multiple tables and joins, affecting query performance
**[#yellow] <color #118888>**__Requires a deep understanding of the data and the business requirements__**</color>
** <color #118888>**__May not always be necessary, depending on the size and complexity of the data set and the intended use of the database.__**</color>
