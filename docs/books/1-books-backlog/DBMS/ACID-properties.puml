* ACID
** Atomicity
*** All operations in a transaction must succeed or fail together
*** **Example:** Transfer of funds from one bank account to another bank account
** Consistency
*** Database must transition from one valid state to another
*** **Example:** Withdrawal from a bank account will result in the account balance being reduced
** Isolation
*** Concurrent execution of transactions must not result in any data inconsistencies
*** **Example:** Multiple users withdrawing money from the same bank account at the same time
** Durability
*** Once a transaction is committed, its effects should persist even in the event of a system failure
*** **Example:** A database crash should not result in a loss of committed transactions
