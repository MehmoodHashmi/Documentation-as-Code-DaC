* Third Normal Form (3NF)
** Overview
*** Third Normal Form is a database normalization technique used to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
*** It eliminates transitive dependencies by decomposing tables into smaller, more focused entities.
**[#pink] Key Concepts
*** Functional Dependency
**** Relationship between attributes where one attribute determines another.
*** Transitive Dependency
**** Dependency between non-key attributes through another non-key attribute.
** Normalization Rules
*** First Normal Form (1NF)
**** Eliminates repeating groups by organizing data into tables with unique rows and atomic values.
*** Second Normal Form (2NF)
**** Eliminates partial dependencies by removing attributes that depend on only part of the primary key.
*** Third Normal Form (3NF)
**** Eliminates transitive dependencies by decomposing tables into separate entities.
** Benefits
*** Data Integrity
**** Ensures data consistency and accuracy by minimizing redundancy and anomalies.
*** Flexibility
**** Supports data modifications and updates without introducing inconsistencies.
*** Query Performance
**** Simplifies table structures, leading to improved query efficiency.
** Guidelines for Achieving 3NF
*** Identify Functional Dependencies
**** Determine the dependencies between attributes within a table.
*** Decompose Tables
**** Break down tables to eliminate transitive dependencies.
*** Create Relationships
**** Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
*** Normalize Attributes
**** Ensure each attribute represents a single piece of information.
*** Maintain Referential Integrity
**** Enforce the integrity of relationships between tables.
**[#pink] Considerations
*** Denormalization
**** Balancing normalization with performance needs in certain scenarios.
**** Denormalization may be applied for specific reporting or performance optimization purposes.
*** Data Redundancy vs. Performance
**** Striking a balance between reducing redundancy and optimizing query performance.
**** Denormalization can improve query performance but may introduce some data redundancy.
*** Data Modeling Tools
**** Utilize data modeling tools to design and implement 3NF schemas effectively.
**** Tools such as ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams can assist in visualizing relationships and dependencies.
** Example
*** Original Table: Customers (customer_id, customer_name, customer_city, customer_country)
*** Decomposed Tables:
**** Customers (customer_id, customer_name)
**** Addresses (address_id, customer_id, customer_city, customer_country)
