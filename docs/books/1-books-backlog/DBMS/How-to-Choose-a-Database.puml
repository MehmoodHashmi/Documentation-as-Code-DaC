* How to Choose a Database
** Consider Data Requirements
*** Structured or Unstructured Data
**** Example: Structured data - Customer information, sales transactions
**** Example: Unstructured data - Text documents, images, videos
*** Data Volume and Scalability
**** Example: Large-scale e-commerce platform with millions of transactions per day
**** Example: Small blog with limited data storage needs
** Performance and Latency Requirements
*** Read/Write Ratio
**** Example: High-read, low-write workload for a news website
**** Example: Balanced read/write workload for a social media platform
*** Response Time and Throughput
**** Example: Real-time analytics platform requiring sub-second query response times
**** Example: Batch processing system with longer processing windows
** Data Model and Query Flexibility
*** Relational Data Model
**** Example: Traditional online retail store with structured product and customer data
*** Document Data Model
**** Example: Content management system with flexible schema requirements
*** Graph Data Model
**** Example: Social network with complex relationships between users
** Data Consistency and Integrity
*** ACID Compliance
**** Example: Financial application requiring strict data consistency and transactional integrity
*** Eventual Consistency
**** Example: Distributed system with high availability requirements
** Ecosystem and Tooling
*** Integration with Existing Technologies
**** Example: Java-based application using an ORM framework
**** Example: Big data analytics platform with Hadoop and Spark integration
*** Community and Support
**** Example: Open-source database with active developer community
**** Example: Proprietary database with dedicated customer support
