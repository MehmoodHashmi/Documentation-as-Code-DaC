****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Example:** Large-scale e-commerce platform with millions of transactions per day
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Example:** Small blog with limited data storage needs
** Performance and Latency Requirements
*** Read/Write Ratio
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Example:** High-read, low-write workload for a news website
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Example:** Balanced read/write workload for a social media platform

****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Example:** Real-time analytics platform requiring sub-second query response times
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**Example:** Batch processing system with longer processing windows
** Data Model and Query Flexibility
