**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>What Is Cardinality?
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white>Cardinality in databases refers to the __uniqueness of data values__ contained in a **column.** It essentially measures how many distinct values exist in a column compared to the total number of rows in a table.
***[#green] <b><i><size:12><color #white>[[docs/books/1-books-backlog/DBMS/images/img_7.png Cardinality Definition in Databases]]
****[#yellow]:<i><size:12><color #black><u>Cardinality can be understood in two main ways:
*<i><size:12><color #black>**Mathematical Sense:** The number of elements in a set.
*<i><size:12><color #black>**Database Context:** The number of unique values in a column, which helps in optimizing how data is stored and retrieved.;

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>[[docs/books/1-books-backlog/DBMS/images/img_8.png The Importance of Cardinality in Databases]]
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white>Understanding cardinality is vital for database performance and efficiency. It affects query optimization, indexing, and overall database design.
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white><b>Query Optimization
****[#yellow]:<i><size:12><color #black>Database query optimizers use cardinality to determine the most efficient way to execute queries.
<i><size:12><color #black>Knowing how many unique values are in a column helps the optimizer choose the best method to retrieve data.

<i><size:12><color #black>For example, in an e-commerce database, the ProductID column typically has high cardinality because each product has a unique ID.
<i><size:12><color #black>This makes it ideal for indexing. On the other hand, the Category column might have low or medium cardinality because many products share the same category.;
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white><b>Impact on Indexing
****[#yellow]:*<i><size:12><color #black>**High Cardinality:** Columns with high cardinality are great for indexing because they allow the database to quickly locate specific rows.
*<i><size:12><color #black>**Low Cardinality:** Columns with low cardinality are less effective for indexing as they result in larger sets of data to be scanned.;
