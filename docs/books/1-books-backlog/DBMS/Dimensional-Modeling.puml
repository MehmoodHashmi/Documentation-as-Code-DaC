* Dimensional Modeling
** Overview
*** Dimensional Modeling is a data modeling technique used in data warehousing and business intelligence.
*** It focuses on organizing data in a way that optimizes query performance and supports analytical reporting.
**[#pink] **Key Concepts**
*** Fact Table
**** Contains the quantitative, measurable data (facts) related to a specific business process.
*** Dimension Table
**** Contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts in the Fact Table.
*** Star Schema
**** Centralized Fact Table connected to multiple Dimension Tables in a star-like structure.
*** Snowflake Schema
**** Fact Table connected to Dimension Tables, which are further normalized into additional tables.
** Benefits
*** Query Performance
**** Optimized for analytical queries and aggregations.
*** Simplicity
**** Easy to understand and navigate for business users.
*** Business Context
**** Provides a clear representation of business processes and entities.
*** Flexibility
**** Adaptable to changing business requirements and new dimensions.
** Key Components
*** Fact Table
**** Primary source of data for analysis.
**** Contains foreign keys to related Dimension Tables.
*** Dimension Table
**** Contains descriptive attributes about a specific dimension.
**** Can have hierarchies and relationships to other Dimension Tables.
*** Attributes
**** Descriptive properties of a dimension.
**** Can be categorical, numerical, or time-based.
*** Measures
**** Quantitative values in the Fact Table that are subject to analysis.
** Techniques
*** Star Schema
**** Simple, denormalized structure.
**** Fast query performance due to fewer joins.
*** Snowflake Schema
**** Normalized structure with additional tables.
**** Reduces data redundancy and storage requirements.
**** More complex query performance due to additional joins.
** Considerations
*** Grain of the Fact Table
**** Level of detail at which facts are recorded.
**** Determines the level of analysis and reporting.
*** Dimensional Hierarchies
**** Representing hierarchical relationships within dimensions.
**** Provides drill-down and roll-up capabilities.
*** Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
**** Handling changes to dimension attributes over time.
**** Types include Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3.
*** Degenerate Dimensions
**** Single-column dimension that exists only in the Fact Table.
**** Typically used for transactional identifiers or keys.
** Common Tools
*** OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
**** Multidimensional analysis and querying.
**** Supports slicing, dicing, and drill-down capabilities.
*** Data Visualization Tools
**** Presenting and exploring data in a graphical format.
**** Enables interactive dashboards and reports.
