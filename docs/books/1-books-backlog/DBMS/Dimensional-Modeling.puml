* Dimensional Modeling
** Overview
*** ====<size:14>**Dimensional Modeling** is a "data modeling technique" used in "data warehousing and business intelligence".
*** ====<size:14>It focuses on "organizing data" in a way that **"optimizes __query__ performance" (reading from database)** and supports "analytical reporting".
**[#pink] **Key Concepts**
*** Fact Table
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Contains the quantitative, measurable data **(facts)** related to a specific business process.
*** Dimension Table
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts in the Fact Table.
***[#gold] ====**Star Schema**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Centralized Fact Table connected to multiple Dimension Tables in a **star-like structure.**
***[#orange] ====**Snowflake Schema**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Fact Table connected to Dimension Tables, which are further normalized into additional tables.
** Benefits
*** Query Performance
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>**"Optimized*"** for **"analytical queries" (reading from database)** and aggregations.
*** Simplicity
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Easy to understand and navigate for business users.
*** Business Context
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Provides a clear representation of business processes and entities.
*** Flexibility
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Adaptable to changing business requirements and new dimensions.
** Key Components
*** Fact Table
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Primary source of data for analysis.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Contains foreign keys to related Dimension Tables.
*** Dimension Table
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Contains descriptive attributes about a specific dimension.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Can have hierarchies and relationships to other Dimension Tables.
*** Attributes
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Descriptive properties of a dimension.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Can be categorical, numerical, or time-based.
*** Measures
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Quantitative values in the Fact Table that are subject to analysis.
**[#a] ====Techniques
*** ====**Star Schema**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Simple, denormalized structure.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Fast query performance due to fewer joins.
*** ====**Snowflake Schema**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Normalized structure with additional tables.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Reduces data redundancy and storage requirements.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>More complex query performance due to additional joins.
**[#pink] ====Considerations
*** Grain of the Fact Table
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Level of detail at which facts are recorded.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Determines the level of analysis and reporting.
*** Dimensional Hierarchies
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Representing hierarchical relationships within dimensions.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Provides drill-down and roll-up capabilities.
*** Slowly Changing Dimensions **(SCD)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Handling changes to dimension attributes over time.
****[#white] ====<size:14>**Types include Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3.**
*** Degenerate Dimensions
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Single-column dimension that exists only in the Fact Table.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Typically used for transactional identifiers or keys.
** Common Tools
*** OLAP **(Online Analytical Processing)**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Multidimensional analysis and querying.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Supports slicing, dicing, and drill-down capabilities.
*** Data Visualization Tools
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Presenting and exploring data in a graphical format.
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Enables interactive dashboards and reports.
