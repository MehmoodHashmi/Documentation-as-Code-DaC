*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>Key Takeaways from the\n<i><color #white>CAP Theorem\n<img:img_4.png>
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Consistency
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>All nodes see the same data at the same time
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Examples:** ATM machine transactions, stock trades
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Availability
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Examples:** Social media platforms, online shopping
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Partition tolerance
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>System continues to function in spite of network partitioning
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Examples:** Cloud-based systems, distributed systems
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:22>Trade-offs
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Cannot simultaneously provide all three guarantees (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
***[#darkorange] <i><color #black><size:32>Different applications require different trade-offs based on their requirements
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>CAP theorem is not the only consideration
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Other factors to consider include performance, scalability, reliability, and security
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Need to consider trade-offs based on the specific use case and requirements

**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Consistency
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>**Example:** Bank account balance should be updated immediately
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Availability
