title = Key Takeaways from the CAP Theorem

* Key Takeaways from the CAP Theorem
** Consistency
*** All nodes see the same data at the same time
*** Examples: ATM machine transactions, stock trades
** Availability
*** Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
*** Examples: Social media platforms, online shopping
** Partition tolerance
*** System continues to function in spite of network partitioning
*** Examples: Cloud-based systems, distributed systems
** Trade-offs
*** Cannot simultaneously provide all three guarantees (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
*** Different applications require different trade-offs based on their requirements
** CAP theorem is not the only consideration
*** Other factors to consider include performance, scalability, reliability, and security
*** Need to consider trade-offs based on the specific use case and requirements


* CAP Theorem
** Consistency
*** Strong Consistency
**** **Example:** Traditional RDBMS
*** Weak Consistency
**** **Example:** NoSQL systems
** Availability
*** **Example:** Distributed Cache
** Partition Tolerance
*** **Example:** Hadoop


* CAP Theorem
** Consistency
*** Example: Bank account balance should be updated immediately
** Availability
*** Example: E-commerce site should be available 24/7
** Partition tolerance
*** Example: Network failure should not bring the system down
