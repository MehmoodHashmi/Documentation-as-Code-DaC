*[#darkblue] <i>Interval Notation
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Introduction
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white>**Interval notation** is a way to represent a range of values on the real number line.
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Open Interval
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>(a, b)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Represents the interval that includes all real numbers greater than a and less than b.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: (2, 5)** represents the interval from 2 to 5, excluding the endpoints.
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Closed Interval
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>[a, b]
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Represents the interval that includes all real numbers greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: [2, 5]** represents the interval from 2 to 5, including the endpoints.
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Half-Open Interval
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>(a, b]
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Represents the interval that includes all real numbers greater than a and less than or equal to b.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: (2, 5]** represents the interval from 2 to 5, excluding the left endpoint but including the right endpoint.
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Half-Closed Interval
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>[a, b)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Represents the interval that includes all real numbers greater than or equal to a and less than b.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: [2, 5)** represents the interval from 2 to 5, including the left endpoint but excluding the right endpoint.
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Infinite Interval
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>(-∞, b)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Represents the interval that includes all real numbers less than b.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: (-∞, 5)** represents the interval from negative infinity to 5, excluding the endpoint.
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>(a, ∞)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Represents the interval that includes all real numbers greater than a.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: (2, ∞)** represents the interval from 2 to positive infinity, excluding the endpoint.
**[#lightblue] <size:14><i>Interval Operations
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>Union (U)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Combines two or more intervals into a single interval that includes all values from each individual interval.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: (2, 5) U (7, 9)** represents the interval that includes values from both (2, 5) and (7, 9).
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>Intersection (∩)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Finds the overlap between two intervals, resulting in a new interval that includes only the shared values.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: [2, 5] ∩ (4, 7)** represents the interval that includes values common to both [2, 5] and (4, 7).
***[#green] <i><size:18><color #white><b>Difference (-)
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Subtracts one interval from another, resulting in a new interval that includes values from the first interval but not from the second.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example: [2, 5] - (3, 4)** represents the interval that includes values in [2, 5] except those in (3, 4).

* Intervals
** Definition
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:18>An interval is a mathematical concept that represents a range of values along a continuous line or axis.
***[#green] <color #white><i><size:18>It is commonly used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and data analysis.

** Types of Intervals
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Closed Interval
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Includes both endpoints and all values in between.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Denoted as [a, b], where a and b are endpoints.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Open Interval
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Excludes both endpoints but includes all values in between.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Denoted as (a, b).
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Half-Open or Half-Closed Interval
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Includes one endpoint but excludes the other.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Denoted as [a, b) or (a, b].
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Infinite Interval
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Extends indefinitely in one or both directions.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Denoted as (-∞, b), [a, ∞), or (-∞, ∞).

** Notation
***[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Mathematical notation is used to represent intervals, specifying the lower and upper bounds.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Examples:** [0, 1], (2, 5], (-∞, 3), [4, ∞).

** Interval Operations
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Union
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Combining two intervals to create a larger interval.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example:** [1, 3] ∪ [5, 7] = [1, 3] and [5, 7].
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Intersection
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Finding the overlap between two intervals.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example:** [2, 4] ∩ [3, 5] = [3, 4].
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Complement
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Identifying the values not included in an interval.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>**Example:** Complement of [2, 6] = (-∞, 2) and (6, ∞).

** Properties
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Length
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18> The length of an interval is the difference between its upper and lower bounds.
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18> **Example:** Length of [a, b] = b - a.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Boundedness
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18> An interval is bounded if it has finite upper and lower bounds.
***[#green] <color #white><b><i><size:18>Convexity
****[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18> An interval is convex if, for any two points within the interval, the entire line segment connecting them is also in the interval.

** Applications
***[#orange] <color #black><i><size:18>Intervals are used in calculus, statistics, optimization, and data analysis for modeling, calculations, and data range representation.

** Real-World Examples
***[#yellow] <color #black><i><size:18>Temperature intervals (e.g., 20°C - 30°C), time intervals (e.g., 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM), confidence intervals in statistics, and more.
