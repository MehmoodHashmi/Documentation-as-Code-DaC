* Sets and Their Properties
** Introduction
*** Sets are collections of distinct elements that share a common characteristic or property.
** Notation
*** Set notation is used to represent sets and their elements.
**** Example: A = {1, 2, 3} represents a set A with elements 1, 2, and 3.
** Set Operations
*** Union (U)
**** Combines two sets into a single set that contains all elements from both sets.
**** Example: A U B represents the union of sets A and B.
*** Intersection (∩)
**** Finds the common elements between two sets, resulting in a new set with those elements.
**** Example: A ∩ B represents the intersection of sets A and B.
*** Difference (-)
**** Subtracts one set from another, resulting in a new set that contains elements from the first set but not the second.
**** Example: A - B represents the difference between sets A and B.
*** Complement (')
**** Represents the elements that are not in a given set but are part of the universal set.
**** Example: A' represents the complement of set A.
** Set Properties
*** Cardinality
**** Refers to the number of elements in a set.
**** Example: |A| represents the cardinality of set A.
*** Subset
**** A set is a subset of another set if all its elements are also elements of the other set.
**** Example: A ⊆ B represents that set A is a subset of set B.
*** Superset
**** A set is a superset of another set if it contains all the elements of the other set.
**** Example: A ⊇ B represents that set A is a superset of set B.
*** Empty Set
**** Represents a set with no elements.
**** Example: Ø or {} represents the empty set.
*** Universal Set
**** Represents the set that contains all elements under consideration.
**** Example: U represents the universal set.
** Set Laws
*** Identity Laws
**** A U Ø = A
**** A ∩ U = A
*** Domination Laws
**** A U U = U
**** A ∩ Ø = Ø
*** Idempotent Laws
**** A U A = A
**** A ∩ A = A
*** Complement Laws
**** A U A' = U
**** A ∩ A' = Ø
*** Involution Law
**** (A')' = A
*** De Morgan's Laws
**** (A U B)' = A' ∩ B'
**** (A ∩ B)' = A' U B'
