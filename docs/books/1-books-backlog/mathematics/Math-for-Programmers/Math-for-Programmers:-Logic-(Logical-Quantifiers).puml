* Math for Programmers: Logic (Logical Quantifiers)
** Logic Introduction
*** Logic is a branch of mathematics that deals with formal reasoning and the study of statements and their truth values.
*** Logical quantifiers are used to express the scope and quantity of statements.
** Universal Quantifier (∀)
*** Denoted as ∀
*** Represents "for all" or "for every"
*** Indicates that a statement holds true for every element in a given set or domain.
*** Example: ∀x P(x) - "For every x, P(x) is true."
** Existential Quantifier (∃)
*** Denoted as ∃
*** Represents "there exists" or "there is at least one"
*** Indicates that a statement holds true for at least one element in a given set or domain.
*** Example: ∃x P(x) - "There exists an x for which P(x) is true."
** Logical Connectives
*** AND (∧)
**** Connects two or more statements and evaluates to true only if all the statements are true.
**** Example: P ∧ Q - "P and Q are both true."
*** OR (∨)
**** Connects two or more statements and evaluates to true if at least one of the statements is true.
**** Example: P ∨ Q - "P or Q (or both) is true."
*** NOT (¬)
**** Negates a statement, reversing its truth value.
**** Example: ¬P - "P is not true."
** Quantifier Negation
*** The negation of a quantified statement switches the quantifier and negates the inner statement.
*** Example: ¬(∀x P(x)) is equivalent to ∃x ¬P(x) - "It is not true that for every x, P(x) is true" is equivalent to "There exists an x for which P(x) is not true."
** Examples
*** ∀x (x > 0) - "For every x, x is greater than 0."
*** ∃x (x < 0) - "There exists an x such that x is less than 0."
*** ¬(∀x (P(x) → Q(x))) - "It is not true that for every x, if P(x) then Q(x)."
