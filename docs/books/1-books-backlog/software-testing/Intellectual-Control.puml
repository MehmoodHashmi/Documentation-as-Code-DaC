title = Intellectual Control

* Intellectual Control
** Focus on high-level design
** Human-based decision making
** Emphasis on code simplicity and readability
** Long-term maintenance and extensibility
** Better for complex systems
** Higher upfront cost but lower long-term cost

* Statistical Control
** Focus on data-driven decisions
** Automated processes and analysis
** Emphasis on code optimization and performance
** Short-term results and quick feedback loops
** Better for simple systems
** Lower upfront cost but higher long-term cost

* Over Time
** Intellectual Control -> Statistical Control
*** As software ages, intellectual control decreases while statistical control increases
** Statistical Control -> Intellectual Control
*** As software stabilizes, statistical control decreases while intellectual control increases
** Balance between intellectual and statistical control depends on the specific project and its requirements
