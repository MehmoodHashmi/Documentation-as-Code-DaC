* BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Steps
** **1. Define** the Feature
*** Identify the business goal or value
*** Define the feature from the user's perspective
*** Write a feature file in Gherkin syntax
** **2. Define** the Scenarios
*** Identify the different ways the feature can be used
*** Define the scenarios in Gherkin syntax
*** Each scenario should have a clear goal or outcome
*** Use examples to illustrate the scenarios
** **3. Implement** the Scenarios
*** Write step definitions for each scenario
*** Implement the necessary code to make the scenario pass
*** Use mocks and stubs as necessary to isolate the code being tested
** **4. Run** the Scenarios
*** Run the scenarios to ensure they pass
*** If a scenario fails, identify the cause and fix the issue
** **5. Refactor**
*** Refactor the code to improve its design and maintainability
