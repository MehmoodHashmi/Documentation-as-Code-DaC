* TDD Process
** Red, Green, Refactor Cycle
*** **Red:** Write a failing test
*** **Green:** Write the minimal code to pass the test
*** **Refactor:** Improve the code without changing its behavior
** Writing Tests
*** Test the behavior, not the implementation
*** Use meaningful test names
*** Write the smallest possible test first
*** Keep tests simple and independent
** Running Tests
*** Run tests frequently
*** Use automated test runners
*** Keep track of test results
** Debugging Tests
*** Use debugging tools to locate problems
*** Follow the red-green-refactor cycle
*** Isolate the problem area with unit tests
** Refactoring Code
*** Remove duplication
*** Simplify code
*** Improve design
