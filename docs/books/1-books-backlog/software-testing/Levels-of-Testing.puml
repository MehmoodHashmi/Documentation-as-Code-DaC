* Levels of Testing

**[#red] [[TDD/Levels-of-TDD.puml Unit Testing]]
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing of individual units of code in isolation.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Typically automated with tools such as JUnit or pytest.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Fast and efficient way to catch defects early in development.

** Integration Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing of the interactions between different units of code.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Can be automated or manual.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Often focuses on testing the integration points between systems or modules.

** System Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing of the entire system in its operational environment.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Typically manual, although some aspects may be automated.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Focuses on validating the system's functionality, performance, and security.

** Acceptance Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing to ensure that the system meets the stakeholders' needs and requirements.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Typically manual, although some aspects may be automated.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Includes testing from a user's perspective and may involve real-world scenarios.

** Regression Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Re-testing of previously tested functionality after changes are made.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Helps ensure that changes do not introduce new defects or break existing functionality.

** Performance Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing to evaluate the system's responsiveness and scalability under different loads.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Typically automated with tools such as JMeter or Gatling.

** Security Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing to identify and address security vulnerabilities in the system.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Includes testing for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

** Usability Testing
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Testing to ensure that the system is easy to use and meets the needs of its users.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Typically manual, although some aspects may be automated.
***[#gold] ====<size:14>Includes testing for factors such as accessibility, clarity of instructions, and ease of navigation.
