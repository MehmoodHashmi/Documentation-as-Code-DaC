**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>What is ArchUnit?
***[#gold] <i><color #black>ArchUnit is a Java library for unit testing architecture and design rules in your codebase.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Key Features
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Automated testing of <b>architectural constraints.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Support for multiple architectural styles, including <b>layered, hexagonal, and microservices.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Customizable and extensible rules.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Integration with popular testing frameworks like <b>JUnit and TestNG.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Support for analyzing Java <b>bytecode, Java classes, and Java packages.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>How to Use ArchUnit
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Define architectural rules using Java code or a fluent API.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Write unit tests to check if the codebase follows the defined rules.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Integrate ArchUnit with your build system to automatically run tests as part of the build process.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Benefits of Using ArchUnit
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Catch architectural violations early in the development process.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Facilitate communication between developers and architects.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Save time and effort by automating architectural testing.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Example Rule
***[#gold] <i><color #black>No classes from the **domain layer** should depend on the <b>infrastructure layer.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black>noClasses().that().resideInAPackage("..domain..").should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..infrastructure..");

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Integrations
***[#gold] <i><color #black>JUnit 4 and 5
***[#gold] <i><color #black>TestNG
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Gradle
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Maven
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Ant

*[#blue] <i><color #white>ArchUnit Process

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Define Architecture
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Define the architecture of your application, including the different layers and components.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Define Architectural Rules
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Define constraints and rules for your architecture using Java code or a fluent API.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Write Unit Tests
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Write unit tests to check if the codebase follows the defined architectural rules.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Use ArchUnit's built-in assertions or create custom assertions to test specific architectural constraints.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Integrate with Build System
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Integrate ArchUnit with your build system to automatically run tests as part of the build process.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Use plugins or build scripts to configure ArchUnit.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Analyze Results
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Analyze the results of the tests to identify architectural violations and inconsistencies.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Use the output to improve the architecture of the codebase.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Refactor Code
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Refactor the code to remove architectural violations and improve the overall architecture.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Re-run ArchUnit tests to ensure that the architecture is consistent and maintainable.

*[#blue] <i><color #white>Steps to Use ArchUnit

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Define Architectural Rules

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Run Tests
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Integrate ArchUnit with your build system to automatically run tests as part of the build process.
***[#gold] <i><color #black>ArchUnit can be integrated with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black>Analyze Results
***[#gold] <i><color #black>Analyze the results of the tests to identify architectural violations and inconsistencies.
