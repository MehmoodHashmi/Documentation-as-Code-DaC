* ArchUnit

** What is ArchUnit?
*** ArchUnit is a Java library for unit testing architecture and design rules in your codebase.

** Key Features
*** Automated testing of architectural constraints.
*** Support for multiple architectural styles, including layered, hexagonal, and microservices.
*** Customizable and extensible rules.
*** Integration with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.
*** Support for analyzing Java bytecode, Java classes, and Java packages.

** How to Use ArchUnit
*** Define architectural rules using Java code or a fluent API.
*** Write unit tests to check if the codebase follows the defined rules.
*** Integrate ArchUnit with your build system to automatically run tests as part of the build process.

** Benefits of Using ArchUnit
*** Catch architectural violations early in the development process.
*** Ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase.
*** Facilitate communication between developers and architects.
*** Save time and effort by automating architectural testing.

** Example Rule
*** No classes from the domain layer should depend on the infrastructure layer.
**** `noClasses().that().resideInAPackage("..domain..").should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..infrastructure..");`

** Integrations
*** JUnit 4 and 5
*** TestNG
*** Gradle
*** Maven
*** Ant

* ArchUnit Process

** Define Architecture
*** Define the architecture of your application, including the different layers and components.

** Define Architectural Rules
*** Define constraints and rules for your architecture using Java code or a fluent API.

** Write Unit Tests
*** Write unit tests to check if the codebase follows the defined architectural rules.
*** Use ArchUnit's built-in assertions or create custom assertions to test specific architectural constraints.

** Integrate with Build System
*** Integrate ArchUnit with your build system to automatically run tests as part of the build process.
*** Use plugins or build scripts to configure ArchUnit.

** Analyze Results
*** Analyze the results of the tests to identify architectural violations and inconsistencies.
*** Use the output to improve the architecture of the codebase.

** Refactor Code
*** Refactor the code to remove architectural violations and improve the overall architecture.
*** Re-run ArchUnit tests to ensure that the architecture is consistent and maintainable.

* **Steps to Use ArchUnit**

** Define Architectural Rules
*** Define constraints and rules for your architecture using Java code or a fluent API.

** Write Unit Tests
*** Write unit tests to check if the codebase follows the defined architectural rules.

** Run Tests
*** Integrate ArchUnit with your build system to automatically run tests as part of the build process.
*** ArchUnit can be integrated with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.

** Analyze Results
*** Analyze the results of the tests to identify architectural violations and inconsistencies.
*** Use the output to improve the architecture of the codebase.
