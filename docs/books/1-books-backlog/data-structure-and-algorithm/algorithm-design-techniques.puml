* Algorithm Design Techniques

** Divide and Conquer
*** Divide the Problem into Subproblems
*** Solve Each Subproblem Independently
*** Combine Subproblem Solutions

** Greedy Algorithms
*** Make Locally Optimal Choices at Each Step
*** Build Solution Incrementally
*** May Not Always Produce the Globally Optimal Solution

** Dynamic Programming
*** Break Problem into Overlapping Subproblems
*** Store Solutions to Subproblems in a Table
*** Use Memoization or Tabulation

** Backtracking
*** Systematically Explore the Search Space
*** Maintain Partial Solutions
*** Backtrack and Make Alternative Choices as Needed

** Brute Force
*** Exhaustively Try All Possible Solutions
*** Test Each Solution for Validity
*** Suitable for Small Problem Sizes

** Randomized Algorithms
*** Use Randomness in Algorithm Design
*** Introduce Randomness to Achieve Efficiency or Probabilistic Guarantees

** Heuristic Algorithms
*** Find Acceptable Solutions in Reasonable Time
*** Trade-Off Optimality for Speed
*** Use Approximations or Rule-Based Techniques

** Genetic Algorithms
*** Inspired by Natural Selection and Genetics
*** Use Selection, Mutation, and Crossover Operators
*** Iteratively Improve Solutions

** Simulated Annealing
*** Inspired by Annealing Process in Metallurgy
*** Start with a Random Solution and Iteratively Improve
*** Allow "Worse" Solutions Temporarily to Escape Local Optima

** Ant Colony Optimization
*** Inspired by the Behavior of Ant Colonies
*** Ants Lay Pheromone Trails to Indicate Good Paths
*** Use Probability and Pheromone Evaporation to Guide Search
