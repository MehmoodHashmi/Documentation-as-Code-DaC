title =__ Data Structures and Classes__

* **Data Structures** and **Classes**
**[#pink] **Data Structures**
*** **Purpose:** Storing and organizing data
*** **Focus:** Efficiency, access, and manipulation of data
*** **Examples:** Arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, graphs, hash tables
**[#pink] **Classes**
*** **Purpose:** Blueprint for creating objects with shared characteristics and behavior
*** **Focus:** Encapsulation, data abstraction, polymorphism, code re-usability (aggregation and composition)
*** **Examples:** Person, Car, BankAccount
* Differences between **Data Structures** and **Classes**
** **Data structures** are primarily concerned with efficient storage and manipulation of data.
** **Classes** are primarily concerned with providing a blueprint for creating objects and defining their behavior.
* Efficiency
** **Data structures** are designed for efficient data access and manipulation.
** **Examples:** Arrays provide constant-time access to elements, while linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion.
** **Classes** can utilize efficient **data structures** internally to optimize operations on objects.
* Encapsulation
** Encapsulation hides the internal details and implementation of an object.
** **Classes** achieve encapsulation by defining private and protected members that are hidden from external access.
** Encapsulation promotes information hiding and allows for better control over data access and modification.
* Polymorphism
**[#pink] **Compile-time and run-time polymorphism.**
***[#pink] **static and dynamic binding.**
** Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated interchangeably.
** Achieved through inheritance and method overriding.
** **Classes** can define virtual methods that can be overridden in **subclasses**, enabling polymorphic behavior.
* Practical Use
** **Data structures** and **classes** are often used together in software development.
** **Data structures** can store and organize the data needed by **classes**.
** **Classes** can encapsulate **data structures** and provide methods for manipulating the data.
* Benefits of Using Both
** By using **data structures** and **classes** together, you can create efficient, reusable, and modular code.
**[#yellow] **Data structures** enhance the efficiency and organization of **data,** while **classes** provide abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
** Understanding **data structures** and **classes** is crucial for **effective software development and problem-solving.**
