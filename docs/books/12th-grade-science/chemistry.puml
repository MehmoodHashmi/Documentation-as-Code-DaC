*:<b><i>Is studying science up to 12 grade is enough?

<i>Studying science up to the 12th grade provides a solid foundation in various scientific disciplines, covering fundamental concepts in physics, chemistry, and biology.
<i>This level of education equips individuals with a broad understanding of scientific principles and methodologies.

<i>However, whether it's "enough" depends on your goals and aspirations. For some career paths or specialized fields within science, further education, such as pursuing
<i>a degree in a specific scientific discipline at a university, might be necessary or beneficial. Advanced studies provide in-depth knowledge, research opportunities,
<i>and practical skills that can be crucial for certain professions or scientific research.

<i>Ultimately, the depth of knowledge needed in science depends on the career or field you're interested in pursuing. While studying science up to the 12th grade is a
<i>great starting point, additional education or specialized training may be required for specific scientific careers or advanced research roles.;
