title This mindmap shows the different sects within Islam. The top level node is "Sects in Islam," which branches off into four sub-nodes: Sunni, Shia, Kharijite, and Sufi. The Sunni node has five sub-nodes, each \nrepresenting a major Sunni school of thought: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali, and a catch-all category for other minor schools of thought. The Shia node has three sub-nodes, representing the three major Shia schools\n of thought: Twelver, Zaidi, and Ismaili. The Kharijite node represents the Kharijite sect, which is a small but historically significant sect that has had an influence on Sunni and Shia Islam. Finally, the\n Sufi node has four sub-nodes, each representing a major Sufi order: Qadiriyya, Chishtiyya, Naqshbandiyya, and Shadhiliyya.
