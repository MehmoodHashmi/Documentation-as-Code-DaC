away from idol worship. Ibrahim's journey includes surviving
a fiery ordeal and the willingness to sacrifice his son,

    was a prophet sent by God to free the Israelites from
    Pharaoh's tyranny in ancient Egypt. His journey began when
    he was placed in a basket and found by Pharaoh's wife.
    Musa grew up in the palace, but upon discovering his true
    heritage, he led his people through numerous trials,
    including the parting of the Red Sea. His story is one
    of faith, courage, and divine intervention, culminating
    in the delivery of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.
* Led to the exodus
** In Urdu, the word "exodus" can be translated as "ہجرت" or "Hijrat"
    in Roman Urdu script. It refers to a journey by a large group of
    people to escape from a hostile environment or any significant
    migration, often associated with the departure of the Israelites from
    Egypt under the leadership of Moses, an event known as "the Exodus"
    in history

**Plato and Aristotle,** two ancient **Greek philosophers,** existed after
the time of Musa (Moses) as described in religious texts. Musa is a
figure from the Abrahamic tradition and is believed to have lived around
the **13th century BCE**. In contrast, **Plato (c. 428/427–348/347 BCE)** &
**Aristotle (384–322 BCE)** were prominent figures in ancient Greek
philosophy, and their lives and contributions occurred several centuries
after the time of Musa.;

*****[#yellow]:==Hazrat Dauood
* Prophet & Rasool
* Followers are called **(Israeli)**
* **Book-2:** Zaboor
**Story:**David, a prophet and king in Abrahamic tradition, was chosen
by God for his righteousness and musical talent. He became a symbol of
faith and courage when he defeated the giant Goliath with a single
stone. David's rule brought peace and justice, and he is known for
composing the Psalms. Despite his flaws, his repentance and humility
led to God's continued favor. His story teaches that faith, courage,
and repentance can overcome adversity and gain God's grace.

* **The Psalmist:** is a composer or writer, particularly
    associated with the creation of biblical psalms, and the
    Book of Psalms contains many of these religious
    compositions. King David (Dauod) is one of the prominent
    figures associated with the authorship of some of
    these psalms.;

**Story:** Isa, known as Jesus in Christianity, is a revered prophet in
    Islam. His story begins with the miraculous birth to the Virgin Mary.
    He performed numerous miracles, including healing the sick and raising
    the dead. Despite opposition from some religious leaders, his message
    of love, compassion, and monotheism prevailed. Isa's life is a
    testament to God's power and His message of love and salvation.

**Plato and Aristotle** also existed before the time traditionally
associated with Isa (Jesus in Christianity). Isa is believed to have
been born around the **1st century CE**, while Plato and Aristotle lived
much earlier in **ancient Greece.** **Plato was born around 428/427 BCE**,
and **Aristotle was his student, born in 384 BCE.** Their philosophical
contributions predate the time of Isa by several centuries.;
