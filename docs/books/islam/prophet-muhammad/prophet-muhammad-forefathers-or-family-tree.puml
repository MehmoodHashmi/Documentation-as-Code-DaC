==**English Language**==
The English language is approximately 1,400 years old. It originated from a West Germanic language and was brought over to Britain in the mid 5th century by the Anglo-Saxons. The earliest surviving examples of written
English date from the 7th century, and the language has evolved significantly over the centuries, influenced by a variety of other languages, including Old Norse, Latin, and French.

* English is now the third most widely spoken language in the world, with over 1.5 billion speakers. It is the official language of over 60 countries, and it is used in business, education, and government around the globe.

Here is a brief overview of the history of the English language:

* **Old English (450-1150 AD):** This is the earliest form of English, and it was spoken in Anglo-Saxon England. Old English was a very different language from Modern English, with a different grammar and vocabulary.
* **Middle English (1150-1500 AD):** Middle English developed after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Normans brought French with them, and this had a significant impact on the English language.
 Many French words were borrowed into English, and the grammar of the language began to change.
* **Early Modern English (1500-1700 AD):** Early Modern English is the language of Shakespeare and the King James Bible. It was during this period that the Great Vowel Shift took place, a major change in the pronunciation
 of English vowels.

* **Modern English (1700-present):** Modern English is the language that we speak today. It has continued to evolve over the centuries, and it is now a very different language from Old English.
English is a living language, and it continues to evolve today. New words are added to the dictionary all the time, and the grammar of the language is constantly changing.
==**AD (After Death)**==
**AD** stands for **Anno Domini,** which is Latin for **"in the year of the Lord."** //__It is a system of dating that is used in many parts of the world, and it is based on the traditional Christian belief that Jesus Christ was born in the year 1 AD.__//

In other parts of the world, alternative dating systems are used, such as the Buddhist calendar, the Islamic calendar, and the Hindu calendar. However, the AD system is the most widely used dating system in the world.

To calculate the AD year, we start with the year 1 AD, which is the year that Jesus Christ is believed to have been born. We then add one year for each year that has passed since then. So, the year 2023 AD is 2023 years after the year 1 AD.

The AD system is also used to date years before the birth of Jesus Christ. These years are designated BC, which stands for Before Christ. So, the year 1 BC is the year before Jesus Christ was born, and the year 1000 BC is 1000 years before
Jesus Christ was born.

The AD system is a convenient way to date years and to keep track of time. However, it is important to remember that it is based on a Christian belief, and it may not be appropriate for use in all contexts.
==**Arabic Language**==
Arabic is a very old language, and its exact age is difficult to determine. However, it is believed to be at least 2,500 years old. The earliest known written records of Arabic date back to the 4th century AD,
but the language is thought to have been spoken for much longer than that.

Arabic is a member of the Semitic language family, which also includes Hebrew, Aramaic, and Amharic. It is believed that Arabic originated in the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread throughout the Middle East and
North Africa with the rise of Islam in the 7th century AD.

Today, Arabic is the fifth most spoken language in the world, with over 300 million native speakers. It is the official language of over 20 countries, and it is widely used in business, education, and government
throughout the Middle East and North Africa.

Arabic is a rich and complex language with a long and fascinating history. It has played a major role in the development of Islamic culture and civilization, and it continues to be an important language for people all over the world.
==**Farsi Language**==
Farsi, also known as Persian, is one of the oldest living languages in the world. It has a rich and complex history that dates back over 3,000 years.

The earliest known written records of Farsi date back to the 6th century BC, during the Achaemenid Empire. During this time, Farsi was known as Old Persian, and it was the official language of the empire.

After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, Farsi continued to be spoken and written, but it evolved into a new form known as Middle Persian. Middle Persian was the official language of the Sasanian Empire, which ruled the region from the 3rd to the 7th
centuries AD.

In the 7th century AD, the Sasanian Empire was conquered by the Arabs, and Islam was introduced to the region. Despite the Arab conquest, Farsi continued to be spoken and written, and it eventually became the dominant language of the region again.

Modern Farsi is a direct descendant of Middle Persian. It is spoken by over 110 million people worldwide, primarily in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Farsi is also spoken by significant communities in other countries, such as Iraq, Turkey,
Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan.

* Farsi is a living language that continues to evolve today. It is a language of culture, literature, science, and technology. It is a language that is spoken and loved by people all over the world.

==**Greece Language**==
Greece is one of the oldest countries in the world. The first human settlements in Greece date back to the Paleolithic era, over 300,000 years ago. The first advanced civilizations in Greece emerged during the Bronze Age, around 3000 BC.
These civilizations included the Minoans, the Mycenaeans, and the Cycladic civilization.

Greece is considered to be the birthplace of Western civilization. The ancient Greeks made significant contributions to philosophy, science, mathematics, art, architecture, and literature. Many of the ideas and concepts that we take for
granted today, such as democracy, the rule of law, and individual rights, originated in ancient Greece.

Greece has had a long and complex history. It has been conquered by many different empires over the centuries, including the Romans, the Byzantines, and the Ottoman Turks. However, the Greek people have always maintained their unique
culture and identity.

Greece became an independent country in 1832. It has since been a member of the European Union since 1981. Greece is a popular tourist destination, known for its beautiful beaches, ancient ruins, and delicious food.

So, how old is Greece? It depends on how you define it. If you count the first human settlements, then Greece is over 300,000 years old. If you count the first advanced civilizations, then Greece is around 5,000 years old. And if you
count the modern Greek state, then Greece is around 200 years old.

No matter how you define it, Greece is a country with a rich and ancient history. It is a country that has made significant contributions to the world, and it continues to be an important cultural center today.
==**Latin Language**==

for much longer than that.

Latin is a member of the Indo-European language family, which also includes English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. It is believed that Latin originated in the Latium region of central Italy, and it spread throughout the Italian Peninsula and beyond
with the rise of the Roman Empire.

At its peak, Latin was the spoken language of millions of people in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It was also the language of government, law, education, and literature. Latin had a profound influence on the development of many other
languages, including English.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Latin continued to be used as the language of scholarship and religion. It was also the language of diplomacy and international trade.

Today, Latin is no longer a spoken language, but it is still used in many different contexts. It is the language of the Catholic Church, and it is used in many academic and legal settings. Latin is also studied by students of classical languages and literature.

== //__**Science**__// knows only two kinds of processes in nature <color:lime>deterministic</color> and <color:crimson>random (non-deterministic) processes</color> and __combination of these two results in <color:brown>**probabilistic processes**__.
= <color:crimson>Randomness (non-determinism) and probability</color> are not freedom. They mean I can't predict your actions with 100% accuracy because there's randomness.

* **Deterministic Processes:** These are processes in which the outcomes are entirely determined by initial conditions and governing laws or equations. There is no inherent randomness or uncertainty in deterministic processes.

* **Random Processes:** Random processes are those in which outcomes involve an element of randomness or unpredictability. The behavior of such processes cannot be precisely predicted; instead, it follows probability distributions.

* **Probabilistic Processes:** Probabilistic processes, as you mentioned, result from a combination of deterministic and random elements. In these processes, outcomes are described using probabilities, which reflect both
    the deterministic and random aspects of the system.

This distinction is fundamental in various scientific fields, helping researchers understand and model the behavior of natural phenomena. Deterministic processes are common in classical physics, while random or
probabilistic processes play a significant role in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and various other branches of science.;

**:=The differences between Nabi and Rasul;
1. A **Rasul** was a messenger of Allah who was given a **new Shariat (codes of law) from Him.** And a Nabi was also the messenger of Allah, but he was not given
any new Shariat and followed the shariat of earlier Rasul. “Every messenger is a Prophet [Nabi], but not every Prophet is a Rasul . All Rasuls were Nabi
but all Nabis were not Rasuls.

2. A **Prophet** is always a Nabi by birth, but a Prophet become Rasul when he officially receives the post and declares it. For example, our Prophet Muhammad
 Sallallahu Alaihi wasallam was Nabi by birth, but became Rasul when he officially got and delivered the message of Risalat at the age of 40.

3. The Rasul receives the message from Allah in many different manners such as, vision during sleep, direct communication with angels when he is awake.
i.e, he can see and speak to the angels during communication of Divine message. But the Nabi differs from the Rasul in that he does not see the angels
when awake but sees during sleep.

4. **The Rasul is higher in rank than a Nabi.**

The Prophet Muhammad was the final and greatest of them. below are the names of 25 Prophets mentioned in the Qur’an in Arabic and English.;

    Musa grew up in the palace, but upon discovering his true
    heritage, he led his people through numerous trials,
    including the parting of the Red Sea. His story is one
    of faith, courage, and divine intervention, culminating
    in the delivery of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.
* Led to the exodus
** In Urdu, the word "exodus" can be translated as "ہجرت" or "Hijrat"
    in Roman Urdu script. It refers to a journey by a large group of
    people to escape from a hostile environment or any significant
    migration, often associated with the departure of the Israelites from
    Egypt under the leadership of Moses, an event known as "the Exodus"
    in history

**Plato and Aristotle,** two ancient **Greek philosophers,** existed after
the time of Musa (Moses) as described in religious texts. Musa is a
figure from the Abrahamic tradition and is believed to have lived around
the **13th century BCE**. In contrast, **Plato (c. 428/427–348/347 BCE)** &
**Aristotle (384–322 BCE)** were prominent figures in ancient Greek
philosophy, and their lives and contributions occurred several centuries
after the time of Musa.;

    the dead. Despite opposition from some religious leaders, his message
    of love, compassion, and monotheism prevailed. Isa's life is a
    testament to God's power and His message of love and salvation.
