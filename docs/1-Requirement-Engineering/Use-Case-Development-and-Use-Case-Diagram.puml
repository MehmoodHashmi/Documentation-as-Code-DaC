title =__Use Case Development and Use Case Diagram__

* Use Case Development
** A technique for identifying and describing the functionality of a system from the perspective of its users
** Involves identifying actors, use cases, and scenarios that describe how the system will be used
** Can be used to identify requirements, guide design decisions, and validate system behavior

* Use Case Diagram
** A graphical representation of the actors, use cases, and relationships between them in a system
** Actors are represented by stick figures and use cases are represented by ovals
** Relationships between actors and use cases are represented by lines
** Can be used to communicate system functionality to stakeholders and as a tool for analysis and design

* Actors
** A person, organization, or external system that interacts with the system being designed
** Actors are represented by stick figures in use case diagrams
** Can be primary actors, who trigger a use case, or secondary actors, who support the primary actors in achieving their goals

* Use Cases
** Descriptions of the functionality provided by a system from the perspective of its users
** Use cases describe the interactions between actors and the system to achieve a specific goal
** Use cases are represented by ovals in use case diagrams

* Relationships
** Actors and use cases can have several types of relationships in a use case diagram
** Include association, generalization, and include/extend relationships
** Association relationships represent a connection between an actor and a use case
** Generalization relationships represent inheritance between use cases
** Include/extend relationships represent additional functionality that is required by a use case

* Use Case Development Process
** Identify Actors
*** Determine who will interact with the system being designed
*** Actors can be human or non-human, such as external systems
** Identify Use Cases
*** Determine the goals that the actors want to achieve by interacting with the system
*** Use cases should be written from the perspective of the actor and describe a specific goal
** Refine Use Cases
*** Add more detail to the use cases, including alternate paths and exceptions
*** Refining use cases can help identify requirements and guide design decisions
** Create Use Case Diagram
*** Map the actors and use cases to a diagram
*** Use case diagrams can be used to communicate system functionality to stakeholders and guide further analysis and design

* Benefits of Use Case Development and Use Case Diagrams
** Clarity
*** Use cases and use case diagrams provide a clear and concise description of system functionality from the perspective of its users
** Requirements Validation
*** Use cases can help identify and validate system requirements, ensuring that the system meets the needs of its users
** Design Guidance
*** Use cases can guide design decisions, helping to ensure that the system is designed to meet user needs
** Communication
*** Use case diagrams can be used to communicate system functionality to stakeholders, including developers, testers, and end-users
** Analysis
*** Use cases can be used as a tool for analyzing system behavior, identifying potential issues, and guiding testing efforts
