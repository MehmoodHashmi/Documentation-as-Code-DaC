title = "__Unix Design Philosophy__\n This mindmap outlines the key principles of Unix design philosophy, including simplicity, flexibility, modularity, composition, transparency,\n and robustness. Each principle is broken down into several sub-points that explain what it means and how it is applied in practice.





* Simplicity
** Write programs that do one thing and do it well
** Write programs to work together
** Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface

* Flexibility
** Allow the user to tailor the environment to their needs
** Avoid forcing the user to use a specific interface or workflow
** Emphasize the importance of scripts and scripting

* Modularity
** Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components
** Make sure each component does one thing well
** Encourage the development of reusable components

* Composition
** Use simple, standardized interfaces to compose complex systems
** Make sure each component is replaceable and interchangeable
** Encourage the development of tools to aid composition

* Transparency
** Design programs to be open and understandable
** Allow the user to see what is happening under the hood
** Encourage the development of tools to aid transparency

* Robustness
** Design programs to handle unexpected input and situations
** Make sure errors are handled gracefully
** Emphasize the importance of testing and debugging
