*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>Definition
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>API stands for Application Programming Interface
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>API design is the process of creating a set of guidelines for building an API

*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>Key considerations
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Functionality:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>what the API will allow users to do
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Ease of use:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>how easy it is for developers to use and integrate the API
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Scalability:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>the ability of the API to handle increased usage and traffic
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Security:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>ensuring that the API is secure and protected against unauthorized access and malicious attacks
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Documentation:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>clear and concise documentation is essential for developers to understand how to use the API effectively

*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>API Design Patterns
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>API design patterns provide a proven approach for designing APIs
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Common patterns include:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**REST (Representational State Transfer):** a lightweight, scalable, and flexible architecture for building APIs
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** a method for making a request from one system to another
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**GraphQL:** a query language for APIs that provides a single endpoint for all data requests

*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>API Design Tools
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>API design tools help to streamline the API design process
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Common tools include:
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**OpenAPI (formerly Swagger):** a tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**API Blueprint:** a tool for designing and documenting APIs in a human-readable format
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>**RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language):** a YAML-based language for designing and documenting RESTful APIs

*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>API Design Best Practices
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Use clear and consistent naming conventions
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Follow standard HTTP status codes for error handling
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Limit the number of API endpoints
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Provide clear and concise documentation
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Follow security best practices
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Consider versioning the API
