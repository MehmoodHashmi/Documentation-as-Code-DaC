title =__API Design__


* Definition
** API stands for Application Programming Interface
** API design is the process of creating a set of guidelines for building an API

* Key considerations
** Functionality: what the API will allow users to do
** Ease of use: how easy it is for developers to use and integrate the API
** Scalability: the ability of the API to handle increased usage and traffic
** Security: ensuring that the API is secure and protected against unauthorized access and malicious attacks
** Documentation: clear and concise documentation is essential for developers to understand how to use the API effectively

* API Design Patterns
** API design patterns provide a proven approach for designing APIs
** Common patterns include:
** *REST (Representational State Transfer): a lightweight, scalable, and flexible architecture for building APIs
** *RPC (Remote Procedure Call): a method for making a request from one system to another
** *GraphQL: a query language for APIs that provides a single endpoint for all data requests

* API Design Tools
** API design tools help to streamline the API design process
** Common tools include:
** *OpenAPI (formerly Swagger): a tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs
** *API Blueprint: a tool for designing and documenting APIs in a human-readable format
** *RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language): a YAML-based language for designing and documenting RESTful APIs

* API Design Best Practices
** Use clear and consistent naming conventions
** Follow standard HTTP status codes for error handling
** Limit the number of API endpoints
** Provide clear and concise documentation
** Follow security best practices
** Consider versioning the API
