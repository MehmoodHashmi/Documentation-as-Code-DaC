title = Bespoke vs. Custom Software Development

* **Bespoke vs. Custom Software Development**

** Bespoke Software Development
*** Tailored to the unique needs of a particular business or organization
*** Developed from scratch
*** Little or no reliance on pre-existing software components or frameworks
*** Highly collaborative process between the development team and the client
*** Ensures the software meets the client's specific requirements

** Custom Software Development
*** Customized to a client's specific needs
*** Based on pre-existing software components or frameworks
*** Development process may involve modifying existing software or integrating multiple components
*** May not be as collaborative as bespoke development
*** Faster development process due to the use of pre-existing components

** Summary
*** Bespoke involves creating software from scratch
*** Custom involves customizing pre-existing software
*** Both provide tailored solutions for a client's needs
*** Bespoke is more collaborative while custom is faster due to use of pre-existing components
