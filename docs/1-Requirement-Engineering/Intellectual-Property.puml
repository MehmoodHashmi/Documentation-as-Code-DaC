*** Patents typically last for 20 years from the date of filing, while copyrights last for the life of the creator plus a certain number of years
** Enforcement
*** Intellectual property rights are enforced through legal means, such as lawsuits for infringement
*** Remedies for infringement can include injunctions, damages, and attorney's fees

* Intellectual Property Issues
** Piracy
*** The unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of copyrighted material or patented inventions

** Counterfeiting

** Patent Trolls

* Intellectual Property Strategies
** Protection
*** Creators can protect their intellectual property by obtaining patents, registering trademarks, and filing for copyrights
*** This can deter infringement and provide legal remedies if infringement occurs
** Licensing

*** This can provide a source of revenue without requiring the creator to manufacture or distribute the product themselves
** Open Source
*** Creators can release their works under open source licenses, which allow others to use, modify, and distribute the work under certain conditions
*** This can foster collaboration and innovation, but may limit the creator's ability to control the use of their creation

* Intellectual Property Management

*** Creators should keep accurate records of their intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights
*** This can help with enforcement and licensing efforts
** Monitoring
*** Creators should monitor for infringement of their intellectual property and take action when necessary
*** This can help protect their rights and prevent harm to their reputation
** Education and Training
*** Creators and their employees should be educated on intellectual property issues and best practices for protection
*** This can help prevent inadvertent infringement and promote effective management of intellectual property assets
** Collaboration
*** Creators should consider collaborating with others to develop and protect their intellectual property
*** This can include joint ventures, partnerships, and licensing agreements
** International Considerations
