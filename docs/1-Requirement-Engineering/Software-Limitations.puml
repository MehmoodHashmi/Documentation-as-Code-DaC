caption <i>Software is indeed not limited by the physical constraints that apply to other engineering fields such as construction or manufacturing. The limitations of software are often more related to the human factors \n<size:15>involved in the development process. The quality of the design, the organization of the development team, the communication between team members, and the overall skill level of the \n<size:15>developers all play a crucial role in the success or failure of software projects. In addition, the requirements and specifications of the software itself may also limit its capabilities \n<size:15>and functionality. Therefore, software development is ultimately limited by the properties of the people involved, including their skills, knowledge, experience, and communication abilities.
