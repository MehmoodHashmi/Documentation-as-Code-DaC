*** Define Goals and Objectives
**** Determine the goals and objectives that the use case will address.

*** Gather User Requirements
**** Engage with users to understand their needs, expectations, and desired outcomes.

*** Define Use Case Scenarios
**** Identify the main steps and interactions within the use case.

*** Document Use Case Details
**** Provide detailed descriptions of each step, including preconditions and postconditions.

*** Validate Use Case
**** Review the use case with stakeholders to ensure it accurately reflects user requirements.

**[#pink] **Components**

*** Actors
**** Individuals or systems interacting with the system under consideration.

*** Use Case Diagram
**** A visual representation of the actors and their interactions with the system.

*** Use Case Descriptions
**** Detailed descriptions of each use case scenario, including steps, input, and output.

*** Precondition
**** The state or condition that must be true before the use case can be executed.

*** Postcondition
**** The state or condition that will be true after the use case has been executed.

**[#pink] **Techniques**

*** User Interviews
**** Conducting interviews with users to gather requirements and validate use cases.

*** User Stories
**** Writing user-centered stories to capture user needs and system interactions.

*** Use Case Modeling
