title =__Decentralized Systems__

* Definition
** A system in which decision-making and control are distributed across multiple nodes
** No single node has complete control or knowledge of the system

* Types of Decentralized Systems
** Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks
*** A network where each node can act as a server or client
*** No central server is needed
*** Used in file sharing, messaging, and cryptocurrency systems
** Blockchain Systems
*** A distributed ledger system that uses cryptography to maintain a secure and transparent record of transactions
*** Used in cryptocurrency and supply chain management systems
** Mesh Networks
*** A network where each node can communicate with other nodes directly or indirectly
*** No central hub or router is needed
*** Used in communication systems and disaster recovery scenarios
** Federated Systems
*** A system in which multiple organizations or entities work together with a shared protocol or standard
*** No single entity has complete control
*** Used in social media and messaging platforms

* Advantages of Decentralized Systems
** Resilience to failures and attacks
** Lower costs for infrastructure and maintenance
** Increased privacy and security
** Enhanced scalability and flexibility
** Reduced risk of data loss or corruption

* Challenges of Decentralized Systems
** Complexity of design and implementation
** Difficulty in achieving consensus among nodes
** Increased communication overhead
** Challenges in regulating and governing the system

* Examples of Decentralized Systems
** Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
** File sharing systems like BitTorrent
** Mesh networking systems like FireChat
** Social media platforms like Mastodon
** Supply chain management systems like IBM Food Trust
