title =__Levels of Highly Distributed System__

* Level 1: Centralized
** One central server controls all operations and data
** Limited scalability and availability
** Low fault tolerance and high risk of failure

* Level 2: Decentralized
** Multiple nodes with distributed control
** Nodes can work independently or collaboratively
** Increased scalability and availability
** Moderate fault tolerance and lower risk of failure

* Level 3: Distributed
** Nodes work together as a single system with no central control
** Each node can make decisions and coordinate with other nodes
** Highly scalable and available
** High fault tolerance and lower risk of failure

* Level 4: Federated
** Multiple independent systems connected by standardized protocols
** Each system retains its own identity and control
** Interoperable and scalable
** Moderate fault tolerance and lower risk of failure

* Level 5: Cloud
** Large-scale distributed systems hosted in the cloud
** Resources can be dynamically allocated and de-allocated
** Highly scalable and available
** High fault tolerance and lower risk of failure
