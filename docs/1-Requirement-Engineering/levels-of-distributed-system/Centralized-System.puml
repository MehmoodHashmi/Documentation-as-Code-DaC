*[#darkblue] <i><color:white>Definition
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>A computing system in which all processing is done in a central location
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Users access the system through remote terminals or devices

*[#darkblue] <i><color:white>Characteristics
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Centralized control of resources and data
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Single point of failure
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Limited scalability
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Potential for network congestion
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Lower hardware and maintenance costs

*[#darkblue] <i><color:white>Types of Centralized Systems
