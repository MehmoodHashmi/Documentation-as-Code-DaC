title = __Federated Systems__

* Definition
** A system composed of multiple autonomous entities that work together to achieve a common goal
** Each entity maintains its own identity, but shares some common resources and information

* Characteristics
** Autonomy
*** Entities are autonomous and responsible for their own decisions and actions
*** Allows for flexibility and resilience in the system
** Interoperability
*** Entities can work together despite differences in their technology, policies, and procedures
*** Requires the use of standards and protocols for communication and data exchange
** Scalability
*** The system can handle increasing numbers of entities without significant degradation in performance or reliability
*** Requires efficient resource allocation and load balancing
** Security
*** Entities must be able to authenticate and authorize each other to access shared resources and information
*** Requires the use of secure communication protocols and encryption techniques

* Examples
** Federated Identity Management
*** Allows users to access resources across multiple systems using a single set of credentials
*** Uses protocols like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization
** Federated Cloud Computing
*** Allows users to access cloud resources from multiple providers using a common interface
*** Uses protocols like OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes for resource management and orchestration
** Federated Search
*** Allows users to search across multiple databases or repositories using a common interface
*** Uses protocols like OpenSearch and SRU for search queries and results

* Benefits
** Increased flexibility and interoperability
** Reduced duplication of effort and resources
** Improved scalability and resilience
** Increased access to resources and information

* Challenges
** Complexity of managing multiple autonomous entities
** Maintaining consistency and quality of shared resources and information
** Security and privacy concerns
** Lack of standardization across entities

* Best Practices
** Establish clear governance and policies for the federated system
** Use standards and protocols to ensure interoperability and security
** Implement effective resource management and load balancing
** Monitor performance and usage of the federated system
