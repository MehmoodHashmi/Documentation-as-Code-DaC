*[#darkblue] <color:white><i>Prototyping
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Definition
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14>**Prototyping** is the process of creating a preliminary model or sample of a product or system to visualize its design, test its functionality, and gather feedback before the final product is developed.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Types of Prototypes
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Throwaway Prototypes
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Used for exploring design ideas and functionality without the intention of being part of the final product.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Evolutionary Prototypes
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Developed incrementally, with each iteration building on the previous one, often becoming part of the final product.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Benefits
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Visualization
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Helps stakeholders visualize the product's design and features.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Feedback
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Facilitates early feedback, reducing the risk of costly changes later.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Risk Reduction
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Identifies potential issues and challenges before full development.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Improved Communication
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Enhances communication between teams and stakeholders.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Prototyping Process
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Requirement Gathering
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Understand the user's needs and expectations.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Design
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Create the initial design or concept for the prototype.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Prototype Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Build the prototype based on the design.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Testing
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Evaluate the prototype's functionality and usability.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Feedback and Iteration
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Gather feedback, make necessary revisions, and iterate.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Prototyping Tools
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Low-Fidelity Prototyping
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Paper sketches, wireframes, and mockups.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>High-Fidelity Prototyping
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Interactive digital prototypes created with tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Use Cases
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Software Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Creating interactive prototypes to demonstrate software features.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Product Design
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Designing physical products or user interfaces.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Web Development
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Testing website layouts and user interactions.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>User Experience (UX) Design
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Improving the user experience of digital products.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Prototyping Best Practices
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Involve Stakeholders
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Include end-users, clients, and team members in the prototyping process.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Start Simple
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Begin with a basic prototype and add complexity as needed.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Test Real Scenarios
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Simulate real-life scenarios to identify potential issues.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Iterate and Refine
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Continuously refine the prototype based on feedback and insights.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Limitations
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Time-Consuming
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Developing prototypes can be time-consuming.
***[#green] <i><color #white><size:14><b>Cost
