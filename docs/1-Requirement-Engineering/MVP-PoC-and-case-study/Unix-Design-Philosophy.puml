title = "__Unix Design Philosophy__\n This mindmap outlines the key principles of Unix design philosophy, including simplicity, flexibility, modularity, composition, transparency,\n and robustness. Each principle is broken down into several sub-points that explain what it means and how it is applied in practice.

*[#darkblue] <i>Simplicity
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Write programs that do one thing and do it well
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Write programs to work together
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface

*[#darkblue] <i>Flexibility
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Allow the user to tailor the environment to their needs
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Avoid forcing the user to use a specific interface or workflow
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Emphasize the importance of scripts and scripting

*[#darkblue] <i>Modularity
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Make sure each component does one thing well
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Encourage the development of reusable components

*[#darkblue] <i>Composition
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Use simple, standardized interfaces to compose complex systems
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Make sure each component is replaceable and interchangeable
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Encourage the development of tools to aid composition

*[#darkblue] <i>Transparency
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Design programs to be open and understandable
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Allow the user to see what is happening under the hood
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Encourage the development of tools to aid transparency

*[#darkblue] <i>Robustness
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Design programs to handle unexpected input and situations
**[#lightblue] <i><size:14>Make sure errors are handled gracefully
