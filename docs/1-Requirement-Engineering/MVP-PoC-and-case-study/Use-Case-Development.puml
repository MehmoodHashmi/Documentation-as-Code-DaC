title =__Use Case Development__

* Definition
** A technique used in software development to capture the functional requirements of a system
** Involves identifying actors and use cases, and specifying the interactions between them

* Actors
** A person, system, or external entity that interacts with the system being developed
** Identified during use case analysis and can be primary or secondary actors
** Primary actors are those that have a direct goal or objective to achieve
** Secondary actors are those that are involved in the use case but do not have a direct goal or objective to achieve

* Use Cases
** A description of a system's behavior or functionality from the perspective of an actor
** Captures a sequence of interactions between the actor and the system that produces a specific outcome
** Identified during use case analysis and can be primary or supporting use cases
** Primary use cases are those that directly support the actor's goal or objective
** Supporting use cases are those that provide additional functionality or support to primary use cases

* Use Case Analysis
** A process used to identify and define use cases
** Involves understanding the system's goals and objectives, identifying the actors, and defining the interactions between them
** Use case analysis is typically done through a series of workshops, interviews, and discussions with stakeholders

* Use Case Specification
** A document that describes a use case in detail, including the actors, the steps in the use case, and the outcomes
** Typically includes a use case diagram to visually represent the actors and use cases and their relationships
** Use case specifications can be used as a basis for software design, development, and testing

* Benefits of Use Case Development
** Helps to ensure that the system being developed meets the needs of its users
** Provides a clear and structured way to define and communicate the functional requirements of a system
** Enables stakeholders to visualize the system's behavior and identify potential issues early in the development process
** Can be used to prioritize and plan development efforts based on the importance of each use case to the system's goals and objectives
