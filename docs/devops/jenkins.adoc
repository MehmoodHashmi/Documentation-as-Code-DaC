Lec-36  How to compile a code that is present in GitHub, Review that code and Analyze the test cases present in the GitHub repository. The Hands-On session also explains how to create a build pipeline using Jenkins and how to add Jenkins Slaves.

Issues before Jenkins came in, what is continuous integration, features of Jenkins, Jenkins architecture, and you will also see a case study using Jenkins. Jenkins is a continuous integration tool that allows continuous development, test and deployment of newly created codes. Jenkins is primarily a build and release tool, it was written originally by the community as a build and release tool. They did not target it as a continuous integration, continuous deployment or an orchestration tool, it was simply used for releasing builds to production but now Jenkins has a lot of other uses like it's a continuous integration tool. It allows developers to make sure that their environments have the exact same code as their code repositories.

* *Continuous delivery:* if your client is technical then you deliver app/code to the client & he can deploy himself or client's employee can *deploy* the #app/code#
* *Continuous deployment:* if your client is not technical then you will *deploy* #app/code#
