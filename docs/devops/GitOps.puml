title =__ GitOps__\nOverall, this mind map should help developers and operations teams gain a deeper understanding of GitOps and learn how to use it to improve their software development processes.

* GitOps
** Definition
*** GitOps is a **software development methodology** that uses Git as the source of truth for **infrastructure and application deployment.**
** Key Principles
*** Declarative Infrastructure
**** Infrastructure is defined in code, which can be version-controlled and automated.
*** Continuous Delivery
**** Changes to infrastructure and applications are automatically deployed from Git repositories.
*** Observability
**** The state of the system can be easily monitored and audited.
*** Self-Service
**** Developers can make changes to infrastructure and applications through Git, without needing to go through a central operations team.
** Benefits
*** Consistency
**** Infrastructure is always in the desired state, reducing errors and downtime.
*** Automation
**** Infrastructure and application deployment can be automated, saving time and effort.
*** Collaboration
**** Developers and operations teams can collaborate more easily, since infrastructure and application changes are made through Git.
*** Auditability
**** Changes to the system can be easily audited and tracked.
** Tools
*** Git
**** Used as the source of truth for infrastructure and application deployment.
*** Kubernetes
**** Used as the orchestration platform for deploying and managing containerized applications.
*** Flux
**** A GitOps tool that automates the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications.
*** Helm
**** A package manager for Kubernetes that can be used with GitOps workflows.
*** Argo CD
**** A GitOps tool that provides automated deployment and management of Kubernetes applications.
** Best Practices
*** Define infrastructure and application changes as code
*** Use Git to manage configuration and deployment
*** Automate deployment and rollback processes
*** Monitor system health and performance
*** Encourage collaboration between development and operations teams
