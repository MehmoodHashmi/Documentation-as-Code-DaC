== 8 Terraform Best Practices that will improve your Terraform (TF)  workflow immediately

Terraform is one of the best Infrastructure as code *IaaC* tools in the world.

Many of the Terraform best practices are around the *state and statefile*.


*State:* Terraform is a tool that automates creation of infrastructure and then making changes and maintaining that infrastructure. And to keep track record of the current infrastructure state and change you want to make terraform uses state.

*Statefile:*

. manipulate state only through TF commands

. always set up a shared remote storage

. use state locking

. backup your statefile

. use #1-statefile# per *environment* (development, testing, production)

Next three best practices are about:

* How to manage Terraform code?

* How to apply the Infrastructure changes?

These can be grouped into the *#IaC#* trend which emerged recently which is called <<gitops>>

. Host Terraform code in its own git repository just like your application code.

. CI for the Terraform code

. apply infrastructure changes only through CD pipeline


. With terraform you will create infrastructure (server, router, switch, network, IP, ram, disk, cpu, etc.)
. with ansibile, cheff, puppet  you can install software on the infrastructure (machines)

* Terraform (laptop) #--connect-># AWS-provider or any other

* Terraform (laptop)#--login-># AWS-provider or anyother

** for login, you need *access key and secret key*

* Terraform (laptop)#-- after-login-># do resource/infrastructure creation

most used and basic terrform commands:
* TF init
* TF Plain
* TF validate
* TF apply
* TF destroy

.To deploy infrastructure with Terraform:
* *Scope* - Identify the infrastructure for your project.
* *Author* - Write the configuration for your infrastructure.
* *Initialize* - Install the plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastructure.
* *Plan* - Preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration.
* *Apply* - Make the planned changes.
