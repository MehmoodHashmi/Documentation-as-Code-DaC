== üî• What is Kubernetes image:images/kubernetes.svg[width=40] üî•

* *#_Kubernetes_# is a container image:images/docker.svg[width=40] orchestration tool, while #_auto-scaling_# (in #_AWS_#) is a tool used for scaling a #_virtual machine image:images/vmware.png[width=80]_#*. #_Containers_# image:images/docker.svg[width=40] are different from a *virtual machine*, #*_EC2_*# is a *virtual machine* image:images/vmware.png[width=80].

** When we needed to scale *application performance,*
what did we use before there was *_eks, AKs and Lambda_*? Well back in the day and
still today it is *_ec2 auto-scaling_* where we took a *_VM_* image:images/vmware.png[width=80] and we told *AWS* how many copies of a *VM* image:images/vmware.png[width=80] we wanted to run or a threshold for when we needed to deploy additional *VMs (ec2)* image:images/vmware.png[width=80] is kind of the *_##old school##_* way of managing *_##capacity in a web application.##_*

*** You have a batch process that needs variable amounts of compute capacity each time it‚Äôs run. So, you leverage Lambda, EKS, or another container-based orchestration layer on AWS, right? What if that batch process has to run in a virtual machine instance? Well, there‚Äôs EC2 Autoscaling. EC2 Autoscaling is elasticity before we had Kubernetes or Lambda. The concept is a fundament of cloud elasticity.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HUk1_w6-1k&ab_channel=TheCTOAdvisor[follow the YouTube link]


* *Pods image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] represent the processes image:images/process.svg[width=40] running on a <<cluster,cluster>>*. By limiting *pods* image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] to a single *process* image:images/process.svg[width=40], Kubernetes can report on the health of each *process* image:images/process.svg[width=40] running in the <<cluster,*cluster*>>. *Pods* image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] have: a *unique IP address* (which allows them to *_communicate_* with each other) persistent storage volumes (as required).

image::../cloud computing/AWS Cloud/containerasprocess.png[width=400]


* *K8* image:images/kubernetes.svg[width=40] schedules, runs, and <<manages,*manages*>> isolated *containers* image:images/docker.svg[width=40] which are running on *virtual machine* image:images/vmware.png[width=80] #or# *phyical machine* image:images/phyicalserver.png[width=80] #or# *cloud* image:images/cloudmachine.svg[width=40] *machine (ec2)*.

=== ‚ñ∫ What #*problems*# does Kubernetes image:images/kubernetes.svg[width=40] solve?

* Trend from *monolith* to *microservices*

* Increased usage of *containers* image:images/docker.svg[width=40]

** Demand for a *proper way* of *managing* those hundreds of #containers#

* Open source [.underline]#*container orchestration tool*#

* Developed by *_##Google in "Go" programming language##_*


* Helps you [.underline]#*manage containerized applications*# (docker image) in different [.underline]#*deployment environments*# (GCP, AWS, Azure, Ali baba, Oracle):
** #*Physical machines*# image:images/phyicalserver.png[width=100]
** #*Virtual machines*# image:images/vmware.png[width=80]

=== ‚ñ∫ *#Node#* & *_Pod_*

* Worker *Node:*  Node (is a #simple server# or *#physical#* image:images/phyicalserver.png[width=100]
or *#virtual machine#* image:images/vmware.png[width=100] )



* *Pod:* is the smallest unit of Kubernetes

** *Pods image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] represent the processes image:images/process.svg[width=40] running on a <<cluster,cluster>>*. By limiting *pods* image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] to a single *process* image:images/process.svg[width=40], Kubernetes can report on the health of each *process* image:images/process.svg[width=40] running in the <<cluster,*cluster*>>. *Pods* image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] have: a *unique IP address* (which allows them to *_communicate_* with each other) persistent storage volumes (as required).

.pod & container
image::images/pod.svg[width=200,float=right]


** A #"pod"# is basically an *abstraction* over a #"container"#

*** #Pod# is a layer on top of #container#

**** #"*Kubernetes*" image:images/kubernetes.svg[width=40] wants to abstract away the *"container runtime"* or container *_technologies_* (like *docker*) so that you can replace them **(container run-time). **If you want to avoid vendor lock-in.#


**** Usually _##"1-application"##_ *per "#pod#"*

***** Inside one *pod* image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] you can run more than one *container* image:images/docker.svg[width=40] and those *containers* image:images/docker.svg[width=40] can share the *volume* image:images/volume.svg[width=40] with each other, but different *containers* image:images/docker.svg[width=40] running in different *pods* image:images/pod1.svg[width=40] cannot share the same *volume* image:images/volume.svg[width=40] with each other.

**** Each #*pod*# gets its own *_##IP-address##_* (virtual address), or its #"internal IP-address"# meaning it is not exposed to the outer world

***** Two or more different *#pods#* can communicate using there *#IP-address#*

****** *#Pod#* can die/crash (if it happens very often,) then a new pod gets created and a *#"new IP-address"#* is assigned to this newly created pod

******* #IP-address# are *#dynamic#* meaning they keep changing


=== ‚ñ∫ Service image:images/service.svg[width=40] & Ingress image:images/ingress.svg[width=40]

* *#Service:#* is also a kind of #IP-address# but it's _**#static/permanent IP-address#**_, service address can be attached to each *#pod#*

** The #lifecycle# of *pod* and *#service#* are not connected if the pod dies the service (address) will stay.

*** Service has two functionalities:

**** Permanent IP (Static address)
**** Load-balancer

* *#Ingress:#* App (our application) should be accessible through the *#browser#*, for this you create:

** *#An external service:#* (the public request *#(http)#* first goes to #"ingress"#, then ingress forwards it to the #"pod"# or (*service-address*)

*** In other words, use *#service#* *(static/permanent)* instead of *#IP-address#* *(dynamic)*

** *#An internal service:#* we do not want our database to be exposed to the outer world, so no direct communication for the databases.

=== ‚ñ∫ ConfigMap ( through ingress image:images/ingress.svg[width=40] ) & Secret image:images/secretes.svg[width=40]

* #*ConfigMap:*# does external configuration of your application

** "Database URL" usually in the *_##built##_* application!

*** In Kubernetes, you connect the "pod" with the "ConfigMap" so that "pod" can read configuration from the outside

**** You can put the database password & user-name in the "ConfigMap" in plain text, but it's insecure, to avoid this we use "Secret"

* #*Secret:*# is just like "ConfigMap" but the difference is it is used to store the secret data (user-name & password) etc.

** The data in secret are stored in a "base64 encoded" format

*** The built-in security mechanism is not enabled by default in Kubernetes

**** Use it (secret & ConfigMap) as an "environment variables" or as a "properties files"

image::images/image-2023-02-03-14-32-20-600.png[width=250,float=right]

=== ‚ñ∫ *#Volumes#* image:images/volume.svg[width=40]

* #*Volumes:*# image:images/volume.svg[width=40] is data-storage, it attaches a physical storage to your *"pod"* on the *same/local machine* where your *pod* is located or on a *remote/external machine* meaning outside the *Kubernetes cluster*. e.g. on-premise data-center or another cloud-service

** There is a distinction Kubernetes cluster & all of its components & storage regardless of the storage is local or remote

*** *Kubernetes* does not manages data persistence

=== ‚ñ∫ Deployment image:images/deployment.svg[width=40] & StatefulSet image:images/stateful-set.svg[width=40]

* *#Deployment:#,* In order to create replica/clone of pod, you will not create a second pod, but instead you would define a blueprint (like class in OOP) for "my-app pod" and then specify how many replica/clone (like object in OOP) of that pod you would like to run. And deployment is the component of Kubernetes which will help you achieve this goal.

** Blueprint for "my-app pod"

** In practice/real world, you will not create pod instead "you create deployments"

*** Also specify scale-up/down, no. of replicas/clone of pods that you need

** #"Deployment" is another abstraction/layer on top of *"pod"*#

** #*Deployment* can replicate/clone *"compute"* but not *"storage"*#

*#Stateful-Set:#* Databases can't be replicated/cloned or with the help of deployment. Because the database has a state which is its data.

== üî• K8s Architecture üî•

.*Kubernetes Architecture and Components*

Kubernetes has a #*decentralized architecture*# that does not handle tasks *sequentially*. It functions based on a *declarative model* and implements the concept of a ‚Äò*desired state*.‚Äô These steps illustrate the basic Kubernetes process:

. An *#administrator#* creates and places the *#desired state#* of an *#application#* into a *#manifest file#* image:images/file.svg[width=40] like _**.yaml**_ or *_.json_*
. The *file* is provided to the *#Kubernetes API Server#* using a CLI or UI. Kubernetes‚Äô default command-line tool is called *#kubectl#*. In case you need a comprehensive list of kubectl commands, check out our https://phoenixnap.com/kb/kubectl-commands-cheat-sheet[Kubectl Cheat Sheet].
. Kubernetes stores the *#file#* (an application‚Äôs desired state) in a *#database#* called the *#Key-Value Store (etcd)#*.
. *Kubernetes* then #implements# the *#desired state#* on all the relevant #applications# within the *#cluster#*.

. https://phoenixnap.com/kb/prometheus-kubernetes-monitoring[Kubernetes continuously monitors the elements of the cluster] to make sure the *#current state#* of the *application* does not vary from the desired**## state##**.

=== ‚ñ∫ Worker Nodes image:images/worker-node.svg[width=100]
* *Worker nodes* are the main components of a Kubernetes cluster that run containerized applications.
* They communicate with the master node to receive instructions and report their status.
* Worker nodes have the necessary components to run pods and containers, including the *#container runtime, kubelet, and kube-proxy.#*

=== ‚ñ∫ Master Nodes image:images/master-node.svg[width=100]
* *Master nodes* are responsible for managing the state of the cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and managing the desired state of the cluster.
* They also act as a control plane, coordinating the work of worker nodes and ensuring the desired state is maintained.
* Components that run on the master node include the *#API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd#*.


=== ‚ñ∫ API Server image:images/api-server.svg[width=100]
* The *API server* is the central management component of a Kubernetes cluster.
* It is responsible for exposing the Kubernetes API, which provides the interface for interacting with the cluster.
* The API server processes RESTful API requests and communicates with other components of the cluster to perform actions such as scaling or deploying applications.

=== ‚ñ∫ Scheduler image:images/scheduler.svg[width=100]
* The *scheduler* is responsible for scheduling pods on worker nodes.
* It receives requests from the API server and uses various algorithms and policies to determine the best node for each pod.
* The scheduler is responsible
for ensuring that the desired state of the cluster is maintained by assigning pods to nodes as needed.



=== ‚ñ∫ Controller Manager image:images/controller-manager.svg[width=100]
* The *controller manager* is responsible for managing the *state* of the cluster.
* It watches for changes in the cluster and takes actions to reconcile the _*desired state*_ with the _*actual state*_.
* The controller manager performs tasks such as responding to node failures, adjusting the number of replicas of a deployment, or recovering from failures.

=== ‚ñ∫ etcd image:images/etcd.svg[width=100] the cluster brain
* *etcd* is a distributed key-value store that acts as the "brain" of the Kubernetes cluster.
* It stores the configuration data for the cluster, including the desired state and current state of the cluster.
* etcd is critical to the operation of the cluster and must be highly available to ensure the cluster remains ehealthy.



== üî• Minikube and kubectl - Local Setup üî•

=== ‚ñ∫ What is minikube?
Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally. It is designed for developers and DevOps engineers who want to test their applications and workflows in a local environment before deploying them to a larger cluster.


=== ‚ñ∫ What is kubectl?

+++

=== ‚ñ∫ install minikube and kubectl
Installing minikube and kubectl is a straightforward process. You can follow the official installation guide on the Kubernetes website. It provides step-by-step instructions for installing minikube and kubectl on various platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.


=== ‚ñ∫ create and start a minikube cluster
To create and start a minikube cluster, you need to run a few commands in your terminal. First, you need to start minikube using the minikube start command. Then, you can use kubectl to interact with your cluster and deploy your applications. Minikube provides an easy-to-use environment for testing and experimenting with Kubernetes.

== Summary:

* A *Container* image:images/docker.svg[width=40] helps an organization to perform maintenance and update without interrupting services
* Kubernetes is an example of a container management system developed in the Google platform.
* The biggest advantage of using Kubernetes is that it can run on-premises OpenStack, public clouds Google, Azure, AWS, etc.
* Kubernetes offers automated Scheduling and Self-Healing Capabilities.
* Cluster, master, node, and namespace are important basics of kubernetes
* Master node and work nodes are important components of Kubernetes architecture.
* Replication Controllers, Replication sets, Deployments, Stateful Sets, Daemon Sets are other important terms used in Kubernetes.
* Docker swarm does not allow auto-scaling while Kubernetes allows auto-scaling.
* The biggest drawback of Kubernetes is that it‚Äôs dashboard is not very useful and effective
