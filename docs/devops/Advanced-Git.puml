title =__ Advanced Git__\nOverall, this mind map should help developers gain a deeper understanding of Git and learn how to use it to its full potential.

* Advanced Git
** Rebasing
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Rebasing is the process of moving changes made in one branch onto another, allowing for a linear history.
*** Benefits
**** Simplifies the commit history
**** Reduces merge conflicts
**** Improves readability of the commit history
** Submodules
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Submodules are repositories within repositories. They allow developers to include external dependencies within their own projects.
*** Benefits
**** Simplifies dependency management
**** Allows for modular design
**** Eases collaboration between teams
** Cherry-picking
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Cherry-picking is the process of selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them to another branch.
*** Benefits
**** Allows for selective merging of changes
**** Useful for backporting bug fixes to stable releases
**** Helps avoid merge conflicts
** Stashing
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Stashing is the process of temporarily storing changes made to a repository, allowing developers to switch to a different branch or work on a different task without losing their progress.
*** Benefits
**** Allows for temporary storage of changes
**** Prevents loss of work
**** Useful for switching between tasks or branches
** Bisecting
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Bisecting is the process of identifying the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history.
*** Benefits
**** Saves time and effort in identifying the cause of a bug
**** Useful for large codebases with complex commit histories
** Workflows
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Workflows are defined processes for using Git in a team environment. Different workflows offer different approaches to collaboration and integration of changes.
*** Examples
**** Centralized Workflow
**** Feature Branch Workflow
**** Gitflow Workflow
**** Forking Workflow
** Hooks
***[#yellow] **Definition**
**** Hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow. They can be used to automate tasks or enforce rules.
*** Examples
**** Pre-commit Hook
**** Post-commit Hook
**** Pre-push Hook
**** Update Hook
** Tips and Tricks
*** Use Git aliases to simplify frequently used commands
*** Use Git hooks to enforce coding standards and best practices
*** Use Git blame to identify who made changes to specific lines of code
*** Use Git bisect to identify the commit that introduced a bug
*** Use Git stash to temporarily store changes
*** Use Git reflog to recover lost commits
