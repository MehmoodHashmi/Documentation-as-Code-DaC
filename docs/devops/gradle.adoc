.*Summary*
Both Maven and Gradle are tools to build modern Java applications. This article has highlighted the key differences between them in terms of *performance, code, usability, and customisation*.
The comparisons indicate that Gradle is now the better build tool for increased developer productivity. Maven still has some use cases where it may be more suitable https://tomgregory.com/maven-vs-gradle-comparison/#choosing[Choosing between Maven and Gradle]
[(see Choosing between Maven and Gradle and the comparison table)], but in general Gradle is the best choice for both small and large projects.
