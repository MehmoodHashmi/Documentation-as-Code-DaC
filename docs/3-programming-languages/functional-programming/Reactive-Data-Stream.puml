title =__ Reactive Data Stream__
* Reactive Data Stream

** Definition
*** Data stream that follows the principles of reactive programming
*** Emphasizes responsiveness, elasticity, and resilience

** **Reactive Programming**
*** **Definition**
**** Programming paradigm focused on building asynchronous and event-driven systems
**** Enables handling and processing of data streams in a non-blocking manner

***[#pink] **Key Concepts**
**** Observables
***** Represents a stream of data or events that can be observed and processed
***** Emits data items asynchronously to subscribers

**** Observers
***** Subscribes to observables and reacts to emitted data items or events
***** Processes the data items asynchronously as they arrive

**** Operators
***** Functions for transforming, filtering, combining, or manipulating the data stream
***** Enables complex operations on the data items emitted by observables

** Reactive Streams
*** Definition
**** Initiative for providing a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure
**** Enables interoperability and composition of reactive systems and libraries

***[#pink] **Backpressure**
**** Mechanism for controlling the rate of data flow in a reactive data stream
**** Prevents overwhelming subscribers with data they cannot handle

*** Technologies and Libraries
**** ReactiveX (Rx)
***** Cross-platform library for reactive programming with support for multiple programming languages
***** Examples: RxJava, RxJS, Rx.NET

**** Project Reactor
***** Reactive library for building non-blocking applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
***** Provides integration with Spring Framework for reactive applications

**** Akka Streams
***** Stream processing library for building reactive and scalable systems in the Akka toolkit
***** Offers support for backpressure and asynchronous processing

** Use Cases
*** Real-Time Applications
**** Reactive data streams are suitable for building real-time systems
**** Examples: Real-time analytics, real-time dashboards, streaming data pipelines

*** IoT (Internet of Things)
**** Reactive streams handle high-velocity and high-volume data from IoT devices
**** Examples: Sensor data processing, telemetry data analysis

*** Event-Driven Architectures
**** Reactive programming facilitates event-driven communication and handling of events
**** Examples: Microservices, event sourcing, event-driven messaging systems
