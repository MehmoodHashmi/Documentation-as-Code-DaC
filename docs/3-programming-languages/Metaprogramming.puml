* Definition
** Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs or themselves.
* Benefits
** Reduces code duplication.
** Increases code reuse.
** Enables more concise and expressive code.
** Enables more flexible and adaptable code.
** Enhances code safety and reliability.
** Improves developer productivity and efficiency.
*[#pink] **Types**
** Template Metaprogramming
*** A form of metaprogramming that uses templates to generate code at compile time.
** Reflection
*** A form of metaprogramming that allows a program to examine its own structure and properties at runtime.
** Code Generation
*** A form of metaprogramming that automatically generates code from a specification or template.
** Macros
*** A form of metaprogramming that allows developers to define new syntax or modify existing syntax.
*[#pink] **Examples**
** C++ Templates
** Java Reflection
** Python Decorators
** Ruby Metaprogramming
** Lisp Macros
** SQL Dynamic SQL
* Best Practices
** Use metaprogramming sparingly and only when necessary.
** Keep metaprogramming code well-organized and easy to understand.
** Write unit tests to ensure that metaprogramming code is correct and behaves as expected.
** Document metaprogramming code clearly and provide examples of usage.
** Be aware of the potential performance impact of metaprogramming code.
* Tools
** Metaprogramming Libraries
** Code Generation Tools
** Macro Libraries
** Metaprogramming Frameworks
