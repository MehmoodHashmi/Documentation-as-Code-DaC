* Maintainability
** Definition
*** <size:14>**Maintainability** refers to the ease with which software, systems, or data can be maintained, updated, and extended over time while preserving their intended functionality.

** Objectives
*** Minimize Downtime
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Ensure that maintenance activities do not disrupt critical operations.
*** Reduce Technical Debt
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Address and prevent the accumulation of technical debt in software or systems.
*** Enhance Flexibility
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Make it easy to adapt to changing requirements and technologies.
*** Preserve Quality
****[#yellow] ====<size:14>Maintain the integrity, performance, and reliability of the system.

** Maintainability Factors
