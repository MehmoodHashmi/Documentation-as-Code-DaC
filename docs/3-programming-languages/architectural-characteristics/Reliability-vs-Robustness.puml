* __ Reliability vs Robustness__

** Definition
*** Reliability: Ability of a system to perform its intended function under specified conditions for a specified period of time.
*** Robustness: Ability of a system to continue functioning even when there are problems, errors or faults in the system or its environment.
** Characteristics
*** Reliability
**** Failure rate is low
**** Predictable behavior
**** High availability
**** Fault tolerance
*** Robustness
**** Fault tolerant
**** Can handle unexpected inputs
**** Able to recover from errors
**** High resilience
** Importance
*** Reliability
**** Critical for systems with low tolerance for failure or errors, such as medical equipment or aviation systems
**** Important for systems with high cost of failure, such as financial or trading systems
*** Robustness
**** Critical for systems with unpredictable inputs or environments, such as internet-connected systems or mobile applications
**** Important for systems where downtime can result in loss of revenue or reputation, such as e-commerce or social media platforms
** Achieving
*** Reliability
**** Robust testing
**** Redundancy and fault tolerance
**** Effective error handling and recovery
**** Monitoring and maintenance
*** Robustness
**** Anticipating and handling unexpected inputs and events
**** Defensive programming
**** Effective error handling and recovery
**** Monitoring and maintenance
** Trade-offs
*** Reliability
**** Can come at the cost of complexity and increased development and maintenance time and cost.
*** Robustness
**** Can come at the cost of decreased performance and increased development and maintenance time and cost.
