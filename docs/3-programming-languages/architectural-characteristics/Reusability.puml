title = Reusability

* Reusability
** Definition
*** Capability of using software components to create new software systems
** Benefits
*** Saves time and effort by reusing existing code
*** Improves consistency and reduces errors by using tested and proven code
*** Facilitates modular design and maintenance
** Techniques
*** Library-based reuse
**** Reusing code libraries, such as Java classes or Python modules
*** Component-based reuse
**** Reusing software components, such as web services or microservices
*** Framework-based reuse
**** Reusing software frameworks, such as Spring or Django
*** Design patterns
**** Reusing established solutions to common problems
**** Examples: Singleton, Observer, Factory, etc.
** Challenges
*** Choosing the right level of abstraction
*** Avoiding tight coupling between reused components
*** Handling dependencies and versioning issues
*** Maintaining and updating reused code
** Best practices
*** Encapsulate and abstract reused code
*** Use interfaces to define contracts between components
*** Use dependency injection to manage dependencies
*** Use automated testing to ensure compatibility and stability
