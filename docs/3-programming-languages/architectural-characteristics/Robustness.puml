title = Robustness

* Robustness
** Definition: The ability of a system to operate as expected under a wide range of conditions and inputs.
** Characteristics
*** Fault tolerance: The ability of a system to continue functioning in the event of one or more component failures.
*** Error handling: The ability of a system to detect and gracefully handle errors.
*** Resilience: The ability of a system to recover from failures or disruptions and continue functioning.
*** Scalability: The ability of a system to handle increasing workload without degrading performance.
** Approaches
*** Defensive programming: A coding approach that anticipates errors and exceptions and includes mechanisms to handle them.
*** Redundancy: The use of duplicate components or systems to provide backup in case of failure.
*** Fault isolation: The ability of a system to contain and isolate faults to prevent them from affecting other components.
** Techniques
*** Graceful degradation: The ability of a system to continue functioning with reduced capabilities in the event of a failure.
*** Failover: The automatic switching of system functions to backup components in the event of a failure.
*** Load balancing: The distribution of workload across multiple components to prevent overload and improve performance.
** Tools
*** Testing frameworks: Automated tools for testing and verifying the robustness of a system.
*** Monitoring tools: Tools for monitoring the performance and health of a system in real time.
