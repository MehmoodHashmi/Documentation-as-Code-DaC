title = Modularity

* Modularity
** Definition
*** A design principle that divides the system into smaller parts/modules that can be independently developed and modified.
** Advantages
*** Encourages code reuse
*** Increases maintainability and testability
*** Reduces complexity
*** Promotes parallel development
*** Allows for easier debugging
** Types of Modularity
*** Logical Modularity
**** Separation of functionality based on logical components
**** E.g. 3-tier architecture, MVC architecture
*** Physical Modularity
**** Separation of functionality based on physical components
**** E.g. Microservices architecture, Containerization
** Modularity Metrics
*** Cohesion
**** The degree to which the elements of a module are functionally related
**** Types: Coincidental, Logical, Temporal, Procedural, Communicational, Sequential, Functional
*** Coupling
**** The degree to which a module depends on other modules
**** Types: Content, Common, Control, Stamp, Data, Message, Uncoupled
** Best Practices
*** Encapsulate logic within modules
*** Reduce module coupling
*** Increase module cohesion
*** Follow modular design principles such as SOLID
*** Use well-defined interfaces for communication between modules
