** ====Importance
***[#white] ====<size:14>Facilitates quick and easy deployment
***[#white] ====<size:14>Increases agility and flexibility
***[#white] ====<size:14>Improves time-to-market
**[#lime] ====Factors Affecting Deployability
*** Portability
****[#yellow] ====<size:14> The ability of the system to run on different platforms and operating systems
****[#yellow] ====<size:14> Achieved by using platform-independent technologies and standard protocols
*** **Configuration Management**
****[#yellow] ====<size:14> The ability of the system to be easily configured and customized for different environments
****[#yellow] ====<size:14> Achieved by using configuration files and tools
*** Packaging and Distribution
****[#yellow] ====<size:14> The ability of the system to be packaged and distributed in a variety of formats
****[#yellow] ====<size:14> Achieved by using containerization and automation tools
