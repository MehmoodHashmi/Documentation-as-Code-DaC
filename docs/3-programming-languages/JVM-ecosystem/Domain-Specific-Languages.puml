* Introduction
** What is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)?
** Advantages of using DSLs
** Types of DSLs
*** Internal DSL e.g. kotlin DSL, groovy DSL
*** External DSL e.g. XML, YAML
*** general purpose DSL e.g.
*** hybrid DSLs e.g.
*** Domain-Specific DSL e.g.

* **Designing DSLs**
**[#yellow] **Choosing a DSL type**
*** General-purpose DSL
**** Pros
***** Versatility
***** Flexibility
***** Can handle a wide range of tasks
**** Cons
***** Steep learning curve
***** Difficult to master
***** Risk of being too general
*** Domain-specific DSL
**** Pros
***** Focused on specific domain and problem
***** Easier to learn and use
***** Less chance of errors
**** Cons
***** Limited in scope
***** May require multiple DSLs for different domains
***** May require additional development effort
*** Internal DSL
**** Pros
***** Embedded in existing programming language
***** Familiarity and ease of use
***** Can leverage existing development tools
**** Cons
***** Limited to host language syntax
***** May have performance limitations
***** May require specific knowledge of host language
*** External DSL
**** Pros
***** Can be developed independently of programming language
***** Can have its own syntax and semantics
***** Can be optimized for specific use case
**** Cons
***** May require additional tools and infrastructure
***** Requires learning new syntax and semantics
***** May have integration challenges with other components
*** Hybrid DSL
**** Pros
***** Combines benefits of multiple DSL types
***** Can address complex use cases
***** Offers flexibility and adaptability
**** Cons
***** May require more development effort
***** May be difficult to implement and maintain
***** May have higher learning curve
