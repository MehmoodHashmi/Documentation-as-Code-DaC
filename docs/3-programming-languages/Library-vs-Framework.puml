** Definition

*** Library
**** Collection of precompiled code and reusable components
**** Provides specific functionality that can be used by applications
**** Application controls the flow of execution and uses library functionalities as needed

*** Framework
**** Structured set of prewritten code and reusable components
**** Provides a complete architecture and control flow for developing applications
**** Application delegates control to the framework and follows its predefined patterns

** Characteristics

*** Library

**** Reusability
***** Provides reusable components for specific functionality
***** Can be used across different projects and domains

****[#pink] **Flexibility**
***** Allows applications to have control over the flow of execution
***** Provides freedom to use specific library functionalities as needed

**** **Focus**
***** Concentrates on solving specific problems or offering specific features
***** Typically has a narrow scope and specialized functionality

*** Framework

**** Architecture
***** Provides a structured architecture and control flow for developing applications
***** Guides developers to follow predefined patterns and practices

**** Convention over Configuration
***** Follows a set of conventions and defaults for consistent application development
***** Minimizes configuration and reduces development time

****[#pink] **Extensibility**
***** Allows developers to extend and customize the framework's behavior
***** Provides hooks and interfaces for plugging in custom code and functionality

** Examples

*** Library

**** JSON Processing Library
***** Provides functionalities for parsing, generating, and manipulating JSON data
***** Application can use specific methods or classes for JSON processing

**** Logging Library
***** Offers functionalities for logging messages and handling log levels
***** Application can utilize logging methods for capturing and managing log information

*** Framework

**** Django Web Framework
***** Offers a complete architecture and control flow for web application development
***** Application follows the MVC pattern and delegates control to the framework
