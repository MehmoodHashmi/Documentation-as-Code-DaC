**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>What's architecture?
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Shape of the major structure of a system or topology. architecture is a view of a system.

****[#gold] *<i><color #black><size:14>If you want to build what your customers wanted, you will <b>fail.\n*<i><color #black><size:14>You need to build what your customers still want.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>The risk of not evolving
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Relevance
****[#gold]:*<i><color #black><size:14>If not evolved may become obsolete & irrelevant.
<i><color #black><size:14>**1-** Team is held hosted by the architects, architect says you will develop it because we architected it.
<i><color #black><size:14>**2-** System does one thing & architecture diagrams on the walls does completely different things, they
<i><color #black><size:14>deliver a "working system" which is not in **sync** with its <b>architecture;
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Governance
****[#gold] *<i><color #black><size:14>**Architecture committee,** slows down the process & "initial architecture" draft becomes useless.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>The risk of  evolving
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>What if we can't support a feature?

****[#yellow] *<i><color #black><size:14>Surprise Features
*****[#yellow] *<i><color #black><size:14>Do **minimal architecture** like **Clean Architecture** so that you can "modify & maintain" the system
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>How to deal with that?
****[#yellow] <b><i><color #black><size:14>Prioritize on value & architecture impact
**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Keep it simple
***[#green] <i><color #white><b><size:14>How?
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Make it easy to understand
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Make it easier to change
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>It has few moving parts in it
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>It Fails less but when fails, it fails gracefully
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14><b>Efficiency</b> is attained not by doing <b>tasks faster,\n<i><color #black><size:14>but by avoiding those tasks that <b>should not be done in the first place.
*****[#darkorange] <i><color #black><size:14><b>E.g. don't do (Clean Architecture + [[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_55.jpg DDD]]) for simple apps (system).\n<i><color #black><size:14>Instead simple **three layer architecture** is enough.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:22>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_52.png Refactor]]
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>50% to 60% of the time you want to

***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Other times you need to 've the courage to

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:14>Reversibility
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Last responsible moment
****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>You either make the decision now or if you do not you begin to <b>procrastinate
****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14><b>Two main reason: \n<i><color #black><size:14>**1-** You are smarter tomorrow than you are today\n<i><color #black><size:14>**2-** If I don't make the decision now, I can go faster focusing on other decisions that 've to \n<i><color #black><size:14>be done now.

****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14><b>E.g.</b> Databases (SQL or NoSQL) etc.
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>E.g. **"Rewrite"** java app in go-lang or C# or python, this is difficult, time consuming & hard to <b>reverse.
***[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>The more you are **couple to a decision** the harder it is to **reverse,** introduce **indirection** to increase <b>reversibility.
***[#yellow]:<i><color #black><size:14>Things which are irreversible (expensive to change) **postponed** them till the end of the <b>implementation.
*<b><i><color #black><size:14>Why don't we postpone?
**<b><i><color #green><size:14>Because we are afraid!
*<b><i><color #black><size:14>If you want to "postpone" we need to 've good "automated testing". (TDD)
<img:images/img_43.png{scale=.86}>
==<i><color #black><size:14><b>(TDD) gives you Control==
*<i><color #black><size:14><b>Statistical Control (SC):</b> is **TDD or unit testing** or <b><color:green>"Test Coverage"
