*[#darkblue] <i><color #white>Observing Applications in Production
**[#lightblue] <i>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_983.png Introduction]]
***[#a]:<i>Managing **Microservices** on the **Cloud** requires far more effort than dealing with **traditional applications.** Getting a clear view of the **status** of applications in <b>production
<i>can make a difference between smooth operation and chaos, between success and loss. This mindmap will discuss different **tools and techniques** that can help us keep a
<i>close eye on **applications** in **production** and how to leverage their powers for a successful <b>production environment.

**[#lightblue] <i>Monitoring vs Observability:
***[#yellow]:*<i>**Monitoring** to keep an eye on the system's behaviour
*<i>**Observability** is the ability to collect details that can help us improve a system's usability;

**[#lightblue] <i>Challenges of modern architectures:
***[#yellow]:*<i>**Distributed architecture:**
**<i>**Microservices**
**<i>**Service based architecture**
**<i>**Event driven architecture**;
****[#gold]:*<i><color #black><size:12>In the past we built really monoliths we cannot name variables properly, we cannot name functions properly,
<i><color #black><size:12>I mean think of the word NoSQL. What does that even mean NoSQL? Is the stupidest name you could think of, and it's NoSQL
<i><color #black><size:12>actually has SQL. So why call it NoSQL? What I really don't like is the word **microservices** because it's neither **micro** nor a **service**
<i><color #black><size:12>and yet we call it microservices.

<i><color #black><size:12>But when it comes to using these kinds of **systems** these are widely classified as **distributed architecture** which in itself
<i><color #black><size:12>is a terrible name. Because if I tell you microservices are distributed then it makes you believe by mistake that **monoliths** are not
<i><color #black><size:12>**distributed**. As it turns out monoliths are distributed. When was the last time you created a monolith that was just one Big Blob that
<i><color #black><size:12>happened about 45 years ago and since that time I've never seen anyone build a monolith which is just one piece that is never distributed
<i><color #black><size:12>you got a database server in a monolith you got application service in a monolith you got different service in monolith so every monolith
<i><color #black><size:12>is distributed as well, and yet we want to call distributed architecture versus monolith.;

****[#gold]:*<i><color #black><size:12>So huge amount of confusion in things we name but in general though when we talk about a **distributor architecture** here
<i><color #black><size:12>we are talking about **systems and subsystems** that can be **deployed independent of each other**.
*<i><color #black><size:12>So the **distribution** here is **not** in the **execution model** but it's in the **deployment model**.
*<i><color #black><size:12>So you can **deploy** each of the parts independent of each other whereas in a monolith the different parts are distributed together
==|<#white><i><color #black><size:12>Monoliths need single or synchronized unit of deployment|<#lightblue><i><color #black><size:12>Distributed architecture facilitated multiple units of deployment|==
<i><color #black><size:12>So you can think about this as a **synchronized deployment** versus a **distributed deployment**.
<i><color #black><size:12><b>So when it comes to <b>distributed architectures</b> there are several of them: such as
<i><color #black><size:12><b>microservices, service based architecture, service oriented architectures, event driven architecture and so on.
==|<#black><b><i><color #black><size:12>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_839.png Choosing the architecture]]|<#blue><i><color #black><size:12><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/Head-First-Architecture.puml Planning the architecture]]|==;

***[#a] <i>**Challenges:**
****[#a]:*<i><color #black><size:12>But a lot of these have very similar challenges one of the very first problems is they have way too many moving Parts in it. So
<color #black><size:12>when you have many moving Parts in it. What is the problem when you have many moving Parts? The different parts can break at
<color #black><size:12>different time, and if the parts don't work properly then you're going to have a problem with the **overall system**. So that requires
<color #black><size:12>a lot more **proactive monitoring and observability** when you have too many moving Parts in it so that's one problem;


****[#yellow] *<i><color #black><size:12>Too many moving parts
****[#yellow] *<i><color #black><size:12>System failures are inevitable
****[#yellow] *<i><color #black><size:12>Failure of a part can affect the overall system

**[#lightblue] <i>Reasons to observe and monitor applications:
***[#yellow] *<i>**Poor Performance**
****[#gold]:*<i>**Loss of revenue**
*<i>**Loss of business**
*<i>**Loss of customers**
*<i>**Loss of reputation**;
***[#yellow] <i>**address issues that impact user experience**
***[#yellow] <i>proactively improve performance
***[#yellow] <i>Keep an eye out for security vulnerabilities
***[#yellow] <i>Identify usage trend
***[#yellow] <i>Improve resource provisions
***[#yellow] <i>Optimize costs (reconsider deployment in cloud)

**[#lightblue] <i>Things to monitor
***[#yellow] *<i><b>User experience
****[#gold]:*<i><b>load time
* <i><b>response time
* <i><b>availability
* <i><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_969.png 2, 3a,3b, 3c, 4b,4c, 9b]];
***[#yellow] *<i><b>application behaviour
****[#gold]:*<i><b>performance
* <i><b>throughput
* <i><b>error rate
* <i><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_969.png 2, 3a,3b, 3c, 4b,4c, 9b]];

***[#yellow] *<i><b>Resource monitoring
****[#gold]:*<i><b>memory utilization
* <i><b>CPU utilization
* <i><b>N/W performance
* <i><b>Disk space
* <i><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_969.png 2, 3a,3b, 3c, 4b,4c, 9b]];

***[#yellow] *<i><b>Database performance
****[#gold]:*<i><b>Query performance
* <i><b>Procedure performance
* <i><b>N/W performance
* <i><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_969.png 2, 3a,3b, 3c, 4b,4c, 9b]];

***[#yellow] *<i><b>Security monitoring

**[#lightblue] <i>Means to observe
***[#yellow]:*<i><b>Dashboards
*<i><b>alerts
*<i><b>notifications;
****[#gold] *<i><b>Note: None of these is the only option you want to use.
****[#gold] *<i><b>Note: Do not configure your system, so it gives you too many alerts. Hence, you start ignoring the alerts.

**[#lightblue] <i><b>Some tools
***[#yellow]:*<i><b>AWS cloudWatch
* <i><b>Google StackDriver
* <i><b>Microsoft Azure monitoring
* <i><b>VMware products
* <i><b>New Relic suite
* <i><b>Dynatrace
* <i><b>AppDynamics Cisco
* <i><b>Elastic observability
* ...;

****[#yellow]:<i><b>What are some of the tools that can be useful now the concepts we talked about so far. <u>You can use almost any tool in the market to be able to do this. The point is that you want to be able to
<i><b>observe some of these things and be able to look into it, but I'm not a big fan of a particular tool I usually use whatever tool is available based on the particular Cloud providers I'm using or
<i><b>a particular application or a client that I'm working with so my recommendation is we can use whatever that makes sense some of them are open source some of them are commercial Cloud
<i><b>providers I'm using. So if you're running your applications on AWS already you can probably use the tools provided by AWS already and that I would say is probably the first good option.;

**[#lightblue] <i><b>Key Considerations
***[#darkorange]:*<i><b>Monitor every __layer__ of the system [[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_969.png 2, 3a,3b, 3c, 4b,4c, 9b]]
** <i><b>Observe database, code, transaction, network, ... performance
* <i><b>Provide useful information and guidance that are actionable
* <i><b>Should not have negative impact on the systems execution. ;

**[#lightblue] <i><b>Monitoring techniques
***[#yellow]:*<i><b>Event correlation
* <i><b>End user monitoring
* <i><b>Synthetic user monitoring
* <i><b>Simulated scenarios;


**[#lightblue] <i><b>Options for observability
***[#yellow]:*<i><b>Logs - When and what is happening?
* <i><b>Metrics - Characteristics of an individual component or part
* <i><b>Traces - How a request flows through the system from the user's point of view
* <i><b>Events -Actions performed in different parts of a system;

**[#lightblue] <i><b>Observability in distributed architecture
***[#yellow]:*<i><b>Distributed tracing
** <i><b>Use our unique ID for each request to facilitate end-to-end tracing, end-to-end visibility, instead of bits and pieces information
* <i><b>Health checks
** <i><b><color #blue>Health checks to keep an eye out for non-responsive services
*** <i><b><color #red>If service is non-responsive
**** <i><b>Reroute to other instances
**** <i><b>Start the shutdown and recovery process
**** <i><b>The service when it becomes responsive again
* <i><b>Auditing and traceability
** <i><b>Some domains (e.g. medical industry) require keeping track of change by users
** <i><b>Use techniques like event sourcing to gather up audit logs
* <i><b>Log aggregation
** <i><b>Logs that are supplied across systems are hard to use
*** <i><b>Maybe lost when the system restarts
*** <i><b><color #green>May fill up the local hard drive
*** <i><b><color #red>Log aggregation
**** <i><b>Helps to collect the logs in one place
**** <i><b>Provides an easy way to analyze across the full-stack;
