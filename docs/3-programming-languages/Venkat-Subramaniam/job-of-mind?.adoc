The statement #*_"the job of the mind is to create thoughts"_*# highlights a fundamental aspect of cognitive function and consciousness. Let's elaborate on this concept:

1. **Cognitive Function:**
- **Definition:** The mind encompasses a range of cognitive functions, including perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and language.
- **Creation of Thoughts:** One of the central cognitive functions is the generation of thoughts. Thoughts are mental representations or ideas that arise in the mind based on various stimuli, experiences, or internal processes.

2. **Consciousness and Awareness:**
- **Role in Awareness:** The mind is closely associated with consciousness, allowing individuals to be aware of their thoughts, feelings, and surroundings.
- **Thoughts as Components of Consciousness:** Thoughts contribute to the stream of consciousness, forming a continuous and dynamic narrative that reflects an individual's internal mental state.

3. **Imagination and Creativity:**
- **Imaginative Processes:** The mind engages in imaginative processes, creating thoughts that go beyond immediate sensory experiences.
- **Creativity:** Thought creation is essential for creative endeavors, as individuals generate new ideas, concepts, and solutions through their mental processes.

4. **Problem-Solving and Decision Making:**
- **Thought as a Tool for Problem-Solving:** When faced with challenges, the mind utilizes thoughts as a tool for problem-solving, analyzing options, and making decisions.
- **Critical Thinking:** The ability to create and manipulate thoughts is integral to critical thinking, allowing individuals to evaluate information and draw conclusions.

5. **Emotional and Volitional Aspects:**
- **Emotional Thoughts:** Thoughts are not solely rational; they also encompass emotions. The mind generates thoughts that reflect emotional states, influencing mood and behavior.
- **Volition and Intention:** Intentions and plans, which guide actions, are formulated as thoughts in the mind.

6. **Continuous Stream of Thoughts:**
- **Constant Mental Activity:** The mind is often in a state of continuous mental activity, with thoughts flowing in an ongoing stream.
- **Mind-Wandering:** Even during periods of relaxation or when not engaged in specific tasks, the mind tends to produce spontaneous and sometimes unrelated thoughts.

7. **Individual Differences and Subjectivity:**
- **Unique Thought Patterns:** Each individual's mind creates a unique pattern of thoughts shaped by personal experiences, beliefs, and perspectives.
- **Subjective Nature:** Thoughts are subjective and can vary widely from person to person, contributing to the diversity of human experience.

In summary, the job of the mind to create thoughts is a foundational aspect of cognitive function, consciousness, and human experience. Thoughts are not only a reflection of external stimuli but also play a crucial role in shaping perception, behavior, and the continuous narrative of individual consciousness.

The #*_human mind_*# is a complex and multifaceted organ responsible for various cognitive functions and processes. Its primary functions include:

1. **Cognition:** The mind processes information through cognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, and problem-solving.

2. **Memory:** The mind is responsible for storing, retaining, and recalling information. Memory involves short-term memory for immediate tasks and long-term memory for more enduring information.

3. **Reasoning and Problem-Solving:** The mind enables individuals to analyze information, make decisions, and solve problems through logical and critical thinking.

4. **Emotion and Mood Regulation:** The mind plays a role in experiencing and regulating emotions and moods, influencing how individuals respond to stimuli and events.

5. **Consciousness:** The mind is associated with consciousness, allowing individuals to be aware of their thoughts, feelings, and surroundings.

6. **Perception:** The mind processes sensory information from the environment, allowing individuals to perceive and interpret their surroundings through sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.

7. **Learning:** The mind is involved in the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills, adapting to experiences, and modifying behavior based on feedback.

8. **#_Creativity_#:** The mind enables creative thinking, allowing individuals to generate new ideas, concepts, and solutions.

9. **Motor Control:** The mind coordinates motor functions, enabling physical movements and interactions with the environment.

10. **Self-Awareness:** The mind contributes to self-awareness, allowing individuals to reflect on their own thoughts, emotions, and actions.

It's important to note that the understanding of the mind is a complex area that involves multiple disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. The exact mechanisms and functions of the mind continue to be topics of extensive research and exploration.

[quote,Dr. Russell Ackoff,]
____
There's nothing you can do to a problem that is better than solving it that is dissolving it, how in the world do you dissolve a problem? By redesigning the system that has it... So the problem no longer exists. Dissolution involves design, a solution involves research, we don't recognize design as a way of dealing with problems as superior even to research we don't teach design because we don't know it and understand it.
____

The statement you provided emphasizes the idea that one effective way to address a problem is by #*_redesigning_*# the #*_system_*# in which the *#_problem exists_#*, leading to its #*_dissolution_*#. Let's break down the key concepts mentioned:

1. **Dissolving a Problem through Redesign:**
- **Concept:** The term #"dissolving"# implies #_eliminating or resolving_# a *problem* in a fundamental way, making it cease to exist.
- **#Approach#:** Instead of merely solving the *#_symptoms_#* of a problem, the idea is to #*_redesign_*# the underlying #*_system or structure_*# where the problem *#_originates_#*. By addressing the root causes, the problem is #*_effectively dissolved_*#.

2. **Dissolution Involves Design:**
- **Design Thinking:** The process of #*_redesigning_*# to dissolve a problem often involves what is known as #_design thinking_#. This approach focuses on understanding the *_##users, defining the problem, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing##_* to create innovative and effective solutions.

3. **Solution Involves Research:**
- **Research-Centric Approach:** While dissolving a problem involves design, solving a problem is often associated with research. Research helps understand the problem, gather data, analyze causes, and explore potential solutions. *_##It is part of the problem-solving process but may not always lead to fundamental changes in the system.##_*

4. **Recognition of Design as Superior:**
- **#_Design vs. Research_#:** The statement suggests that, sometimes, redesigning a system is a superior approach to dealing with problems compared to #*_traditional research-based solutions._*# Design is seen as a transformative and holistic way to address issues at their core.

5. **Challenges in Recognizing Design:**
- **Limited Recognition:** The statement notes that design is not always recognized as a superior method, possibly due to a lack of understanding or emphasis on traditional research approaches. Design thinking might not be as widely taught or acknowledged as part of problem-solving methodologies.

**#_Elaboration_#:**

- **Design Thinking Perspective:** Design thinking involves empathy, creativity, and a holistic view of problems. It encourages a shift from solving immediate issues to understanding and transforming the systems that give rise to those issues. This aligns with the notion of dissolving problems through redesign.

- **Example:** Consider a company facing consistent product defects. Instead of just addressing each defect individually (research-based solution), design thinking may involve reevaluating the entire production process, leading to a redesigned and more reliable system.

- **Education and Awareness:** The statement suggests that there might be a lack of recognition and understanding of design thinking in problem-solving methodologies. Educating individuals about the principles of design and promoting its application could enhance problem-solving approaches.

In summary, the idea is that while research is valuable in solving problems, design thinking offers a powerful approach to dissolve problems at their roots by fundamentally changing the systems in which they occur. Recognizing the significance of design as a problem-solving tool can lead to more transformative and sustainable solutions.
