* =12 qualities of good architect
** =1- be a mentor, not a tormentor (bulldozer, harasser, intimidator, ruffian)
***  nurturing is your professional responsibility
*** = Knowledge is a wealth that grows when given
** =3- Criticize ideas, not people
*** = Architecting is evaluating tradeoff
*** = debating with knives
** =6- guide, don't dictate
** =7- Practice collective ownership
** =8- reduce truck factor
** =9- prototypes beat any arguments
** =10- gain domain expertise
*** = 3 kinds of people:
**** = Those who know:
***** =<color #red>1- __software but not domain__
***** =<color #red>2- __domain but not software__
***** =<color #red>3- __both software and domain__, are very few
** =11- learn to unlearn
*** learning is relatively easy when compared to unlearn
*** Diversify your knowledge portfolio
*** Pragmatic Programmers:
**** "We should learn at least one new language each year", does not mean you know **Java now learn C#**
**** The amount of time you need to learn something new is inversely proportional to the number of different things you 've\n learned in the past few years.
** =12- Write code
*** = In some companies architect means I don't code anymore, and I'm power-point architect
