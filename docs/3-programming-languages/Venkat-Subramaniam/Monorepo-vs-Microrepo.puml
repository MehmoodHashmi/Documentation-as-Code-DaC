**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_588.png Monorepo]]
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Single repository that contains all the code, projects, and assets of an organization.
****[#a] *<i><color #black><size:12><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_589.png Is monorepo and microrepo is same as monolith and microservices?]]

***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Advantages
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Centralized Codebase
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>All code is in one place, simplifying versioning and dependency management.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Shared Libraries
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Easier sharing of common libraries and components.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Cross-Project Refactoring
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Simplifies refactoring across different projects.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12><b><b>Consistent Builds
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Uniform build and test processes for the entire codebase.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Challenges
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Scalability
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Large codebases can become challenging to manage.

****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Access Control
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Limited access control granularity for different projects.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Tooling
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Tooling may need to handle the complexity of a large repository.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_588.png Microrepo]]
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Multiple independent repositories, each containing a specific project or service.
****[#a] *<i><color #black><size:12><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_589.png Is monorepo and microrepo is same as monolith and microservices?]]

****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Code Discoverability
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Finding and understanding code across multiple repositories.

**[#lightblue] <i><color #black><size:12>Considerations
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Team Structure
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Monorepo may align better with centralized teams.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Microrepo may suit distributed or independently working teams.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Project Size
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Monorepo is suitable for smaller to medium-sized projects.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Microrepo scales well for large and complex projects.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Continuous Integration
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Monorepo may require more robust CI systems.
