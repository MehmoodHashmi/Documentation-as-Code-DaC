*[#darkblue] <color:white><i>From Connection to \n<i><color:white>Relation & then Function
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Connection
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Identify **association or connection** between some ideas or concepts or variables. And then finding a **strong relationship** between them.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12><b>Indicates a link or association between entities or systems
****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>Can be <b>physical or conceptual
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Examples
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Internet connection
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Neural connections in the brain

***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Association strength
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Strength of **association or connection** between some ideas or concepts or variables is <b>weakest.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Relation
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Describes an **association or link** between <b>elements or concepts
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Defines **how entities** are <b>related or connected
****[#darkorange] <i><color #black><size:12>Every **"function"** is a **relation,** but every **"relation"** is not a <b>function.
*****[#gold]:<i><color #black><size:12>But you can convert a **relation into a function** by applying <b>restriction/extension
<i><color #black><size:12>on **relation.** Meaning by manipulating **(domain & range)** of the <b>relation.
<img:images/img_70.png{scale=.812}>
*<i><color #black><size:12>Don't hard wire yourself into **domain & range** in terms of **numbers** or only **digits** you can think
<i><color #black><size:12>of **scale (scalability)** as well. **Scale** can also be **extended & restricted.** Sometimes something
<i><color #black><size:12>does not seems to be revolutionary when imagined or executed at small scale but when done at
<i><color #black><size:12>large scale it becomes horrendous, horrible, even does paradigm shift & mind-shift.;
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:12>**Construct or deconstruct** an <b>idea/thought
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Examples
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Family relationships <b>(e.g., parent-child)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Database table relationships <b>(e.g., one-to-many)
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:12>Function
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Describes a **mathematical or logical relationship** between <b>variables
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12><b>Maps each element of a set to exactly one element of another set
****[#darkorange] <i><color #black><size:12>Every **"function"** is a **relation,** but every **"relation"** is not a <b>function.
****[#darkorange]:<i><color #black><size:12>**Function** is **science, engineering & technology.** **Why?** Because **function** is <b>reproducible.
*<i><color #black><size:12>Everything which is **reproducible** & can be **explained** is **science.** Relation is not science. It is not not <b>reproducible.
*<i><color #black><size:12>What is <b>reproducible?
**<i><color #black><size:12>You are someone else if **follows the procedure/steps** can get the same results irrespective of how many times
<i><color #black><size:12>   the **procedure** is <b>carried out.;
*****[#a]:<i><color #black><size:12><b>I Can relate to this from FSc:
*<i><color #black><size:12>Construction/Setup <b>(at high level) \t<i><color #white><b><size:12>--is-> function
*<i><color #black><size:12>Working & **why** its working? \t<i><color #white><b><size:12>--is-> Explanation of function
*<i><color #black><size:12>**And the reason** its working! \t<i><color #white><b><size:12>--is-> You can deconstruct/construct this function by exploiting
<i><color #white><size:12><b>its domain & range through (restricted/extension). And the function will stop working/behaving
==<i><color #green><size:14><b>Two more very basic things related to functions==
<i><color #white><size:12><b>1- function composition f() * f1() = f2()
<i><color #white><size:12><b>2- "Inverse" of a function;

****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Mathematical functions<b> (e.g., f(x) = x^2)
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:12>Programming functions <b>(e.g., a function that computes the square root)
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:12>Function Types
