*[#darkblue] <i>Circuit Breakers
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Overview
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Definition
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Software pattern to manage and prevent system failures during network or service interactions.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Purpose
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Fault Tolerance
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Prevents cascading failures by detecting and handling faults.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Graceful Degradation
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Maintains partial functionality when services fail or experience issues.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Analogous to Physical Circuit Breakers
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Stops electrical flow when a fault occurs, preventing damage.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Restores flow once the issue is resolved.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Working Principles
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>States
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14><b>Closed
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Normal operation, allowing requests to pass through.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14><b>Open
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Blocks requests, indicating a failure or issue.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14><b>Half-Open
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Allows limited requests to test if the underlying system is functional.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Failure Thresholds
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Defines conditions triggering state transitions.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Failure Rate, Latency, Error Rates are common thresholds.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Timeouts and Retries
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Time-based settings for transitioning between states and re-establishing connections.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Implementation
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Libraries and Frameworks
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Hystrix
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Provides circuit breaker patterns and fault tolerance capabilities.
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Resilience4j
*****[#gold] <i><color #black><size:14>Lightweight and flexible library for implementing circuit breakers in Java.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Custom Implementations
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Tailored circuit breaker logic designed specifically for application needs.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Integration with Service Mesh
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Utilizes service mesh frameworks to automate circuit breaker behavior in microservices.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Benefits
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Fault Isolation
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Prevents system-wide failures by isolating faulty services or components.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Resilience
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Enhances system resilience by handling and recovering from failures.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Monitoring and Metrics
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Provides insights into system health and performance through collected data.
**[#lightblue] <i><color #blac><size:14>Best Practices
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Configuration Tuning
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Adjust thresholds and timeouts based on system behavior and requirements.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Fail-Fast Approach
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Quickly detect faults and limit the impact on the system by opening the circuit.
***[#green] <b><i><color #white><size:14>Circuit Breaker Dashboard
****[#yellow] <i><color #black><size:14>Visualization of circuit breaker states and performance metrics for monitoring.
