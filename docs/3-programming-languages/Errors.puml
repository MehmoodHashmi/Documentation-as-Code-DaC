* Errors

** Types of Errors
*** Syntax errors
*** Runtime errors
*** Logical errors

** Handling Errors
*** Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
*** Use finally blocks to ensure that code is executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
*** Use throw statements to manually throw exceptions.
*** Use checked and unchecked exceptions appropriately.

** Debugging
*** Use debugging tools to identify and fix errors.
*** Use print statements or logging to help with debugging.
*** Use breakpoints to pause code execution and inspect variables.
*** Use step-by-step debugging to step through code and identify errors.

** Testing
*** Write unit tests to identify errors and ensure that code behaves as expected.
*** Use test-driven development (TDD) to catch errors early in the development process.
*** Use integration tests to test the interaction between different components.

** Prevention
*** Follow coding best practices to prevent errors from occurring.
*** Use design patterns to reduce the likelihood of errors.
*** Refactor code to eliminate code smells and reduce the risk of errors.
*** Use static analysis tools to identify potential errors before they occur.

** Continuous Improvement
*** Use post-mortem analysis to identify the root cause of errors and implement improvements.
*** Use code reviews to identify potential errors and share best practices.
*** Monitor and analyze error logs to detect patterns and prevent future errors.
