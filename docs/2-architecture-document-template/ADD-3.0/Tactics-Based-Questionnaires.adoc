=== Tactics-Based Questionnaires

____
This appendix provides a set of tactics-based questionnaires for the
seven most important quality attributes: *availability, interoperability,
modifiability, performance, security, testability, and usability*.
How do we know that these are the seven most important ones? This
decision was based on an analysis of the quality attributes that were
elicited from stakeholders in more than 15 years of SEI ATAM data.

In addition to these “top seven”, we include a tactics-based
questionnaire for DevOps, which is a combination of tactics from
modifiability, availability, performance, and testability, to illustrate
how simple it is to tailor such questionnaires for your own use.
____

==== link:#_bookmark5[Using the Questionnaires]

____
These questionnaires could **[.underline]#be used by an analyst, who
poses each question, in turn, to the architect and records the
responses, as a means of conducting a lightweight architecture review.
Alternatively, the questionnaires could be employed as a set of
reflective questions, that you could, on your own, use to examine your
architecture.#**

In either case, to use these questionnaires, simply follow these four
steps:

1. Foreach tactics question, fill the “*Supported*” column with *Y* if the
tactic is supported in the architecture and with *N* otherwise. The
tactic name in the “Tactics Question” column appears in *bold.*
____

[arabic, start=2]
. If the answer in the “Supported” column is *Y*, then in the “Design
Decisions and Location” column describe the specific design decisions
made to support the tactic and enumerate where these decisions are
manifested (located) in the architecture. For example, indicate which
code modules, frameworks, or packages implement this tactic.
. In the “Risk” column, indicate the anticipated/experienced difficulty
or risk of implementing the tactic using a #*(H = high, M = medium, L = low)*# scale. For example, a tactic that was of medium difficulty or risk
to implement (or which is anticipated to be of medium difficulty, if it
has not yet been implemented) would be labeled M.
. In the “Rationale” column, describe the rationale for the design
decisions made (including a decision to _not_ use this tactic). Briefly
explain the implications of this decision. For example, you might
explain the rationale and implications of the decision in terms of the
effort on cost, schedule, evolution, and so forth.
