What is the value of this product/idea? \nDo your market research, competitive analysis, understand his business plans, check competitors if any. How much this person will earn when this product will launch in the market.\n Will people accept this product? I try to know, what is the client's way of thinking? Did the client complete homework on his product? Had he spent his time on this product?\nBecause many clients in the industry come up with ideas which they had last night in their dream. And next morning they post this idea on Upwork. And such clients themselves do not know, how this idea will execute.\n How this idea will develop? What is the level of acceptance of this product/idea in the market? Who is the target audience of this product/idea? Such client start executing the product idea without any competitive analysis or \n Proof of Concept (POC). They 've the required money for it but the job post on Upwork based on thought/idea/impulse. But when someone (freelancer/developer/agency) takes on their idea and after 1 or 2 month the client \nsays ahah I don't want to proceed further because I'm not enjoying it anymore or now he can see that this product/idea will not be successful in the market. And he closes the project. Now the project is closed, but what\n 've you gained? Nothing. Now, you will start looking for for another client on Upwork and this goes on and on.<color #red> This happened because you had not __checked/assessed__ the __competency level of the client.__</color> I always check the \npersistence of the client. Does he know, how much effort/energy is require by the task/idea he needs to be develop? Because such clients are fool. As they think we will post this idea on upwokr, this product will develop.\nWe will launch it. And people (customers) will buy instantly. These client don't know anything about the struggle. <color #crimson>And on the other side some clients know the struggle exactly. They tell you in very beginning this gonna\n  be difficult, very tough. We will make/do it together. Meaning they understand you, and when you educate them they can anticipate based on their rationality that how much difficult it is. It need hardworking. Resultantly,\n they don't associate the unnecessary expectations with you and also don't expect favor/things from you like foolish. You can go very long with such clients. You 've to check does this client has the marketing sense, \nwill he be able to keep this product alive. If yes then he is the right client. With such a client if you 've to work for free don't worry go do it. Because your business success does not depends on client's pocket instead it is \n based on the success of the  product which you are developing for him. And this product cannot be successful just based on you input until the client himself is competent enough and is working hard as much as \n needed/demanded by this product. <color #red> In short the way client check your competence level, in the same manner you should also check the competence level of the client. \n Currently you are putting same efforts and dealing a <size:18>//__bad client, middle man client and ideal/nice client__//</size> in the same way, and this bad approach.

*[#a] ==Mistakes to avoid in a business & freelancing (tips to win a client)
**[#yellow]:=Mistake-1
Let's consider a scenario where you're initiating a conversation with a client or an important person for the first time. If you begin discussing a
topic (let's call it "topic-1") but they show interest in another subject ("topic-2"), it's crucial to adapt. Continuing on topic-1 may lead to disinterest,
hindering the conversation's progress and triggering their subconscious rejection. However, by addressing topic-2, their area of interest, you'll engage
their attention, gain their value, and create a more successful conversation.

Now, when you're starting a conversation with a client and aren't aware of their preferred topics, it's essential not to immediately dive into a subject.
Instead, initiate a relaxed, casual conversation to gauge their interests. Suggest a few topics and observe where their interest lies. If they don't respond
positively to a particular subject, pivot the conversation and explore other topics. Failing to adapt can lead to disapproval, potentially affecting your
business prospects. Hence, the ability to adjust during a conversation is paramount.
