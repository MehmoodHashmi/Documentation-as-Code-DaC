title =<i><b><u>Criteria for Tracking Time on Upwork
*:<i><size:14>I'm working on Upwork as a freelancer. When I track time for my work I suspect myself for not knowing when I should track my time.
==<i><size:14><b>Answer==
<i><size:14>When using Upwork's desktop app to track your working hours as a freelancer, there isn't a strict universal criterion, but there are common practices and guidelines to consider:

<i><size:14>  1. **Work Sessions:** Start the time tracker when you begin focused work on a project or task. This could be when you start working on client-specific tasks, meetings, or any activity directly related to the project.
<i><size:14>  2. **Clear Breaks:** Pause the time tracker during breaks or activities not directly related to the project. This might include personal breaks, unrelated tasks, or interruptions that significantly detract from your work.
<i><size:14>  3. **Client Communication:** If you're engaged in client calls, meetings, or discussions directly related to the project, track this time as billable hours. However, if the conversation veers off-topic or isn't related
<i><size:14>  to project details, it might not be billable.
<i><size:14>  4. **Documentation and Research:** Time spent on project-related research or necessary documentation could be tracked as billable hours if it directly contributes to the project's progress or deliverables.
<i><size:14>  5. **Task Completion:** Stop the time tracker when you complete the specific task or reach a natural stopping point within the task.
<i><size:14>  6. **Transparency:** Ensure your time tracking is transparent and honest. Accurately log your working hours to reflect the actual time spent on client-related work.
<i><size:14>  7. **Client Agreements:** If you have specific agreements or contracts with clients regarding billing methods or time tracking, abide by those terms. Some clients might prefer a different method of tracking or billing.
<i><size:14>  8. **Upwork Policies:** Adhere to Upwork's policies and guidelines regarding time tracking. Ensure that your logged hours align with the work you've actually completed.
<i><size:14>  Remember, communication is key. If you're uncertain about when to track time for a specific activity, it's advisable to communicate with the client. Discuss the parameters for time tracking and clarify any uncertainties
<i><size:14>  to ensure transparency and mutual understanding.;
