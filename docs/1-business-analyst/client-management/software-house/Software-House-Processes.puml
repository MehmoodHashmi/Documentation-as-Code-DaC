**[#lightblue] <i><size:12><color #black>In the life-cycle of an Organization
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white><b>Do members develop love & respect for each other?
****[#yellow] <i><size:12><color #black>No, It's false
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white><b>Do members develop mutual family & business relationships?
****[#yellow] <i><size:12><color #black>Yes, It's True (in terms of mutual profit & losses in business & family relationships)
****[#yellow]:<i><size:12><color #black>Moreover, this is the **cancer or rust** for the life or existence of organization itself
<b><i><size:12><color #black>Cancer or rust:
*<i><size:12><color #black>(Khushamide) fox behavior
*<i><size:12><color #black>Adjustment
*<i><size:12><color #black>Compromise
*<i><size:12><color #black>The Truth which brought the members together & the impedance & the message of the organization
<i><size:12><color #black>becomes secondary (or takes backstage position)
*<i><size:12><color #black>The members of the organization start getting into self preservation, In other words the academics
<i><size:12><color #black>works of the organization becomes secondary or the purpose of of the organization falls behind &
<i><size:12><color #black>the preservation of the organization & the improvement of relationships between the members of the
<i><size:12><color #black>organization to gain benefits is practiced.
<i><size:12><color #black>Hence members spend or consume all their resources (time, energy, & money) in this.;
****[#orange]:<i><size:12><color #black>This is a natural process that after sometime an organization does not stick to it original idealogy.
<i><size:12><color #black>And you can't change this.;
***[#green] <i><size:12><color #white>**When should a disciplined organization should be established?**
****[#orange]:<i><size:12><color #black>When an organization is about to enter the active phase.
<i><size:12><color #black>In Dr. Israr Ahmed Terminology, there are two phases of an organization <b>(Active & Passive)
<i><size:12><color #black>**Active Phase:** is like the situation of PTI before election 8-feb-2024
<i><size:12><color #black>E.g. PTI will make govenment or it will die
<i><size:12><color #black>**Passive Phase:** mind shift, developing mind set, educating, brain train, brain washing
==|<i><size:12><color #black><b>When is the right time to create organization?|==
<i><size:12><color #black>So you should create an organization when you decide to enter into active phase.
<i><size:12><color #black>In other words, you've completed the **prerequisites** to enter into active phase.
<i><size:12><color #black>**Prerequisites:** means creating or producing material conditions such as right people,
<i><size:12><color #black>Product (vision or ideas), technology, money, & other resources
==|<#black><i><size:12><color #black><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_62.png Heavy Weight discipline or Process]]|<#grey><i><size:12><color #black><b>[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/4-Stages-of-Violence.puml More on discipline]]|==
<i><size:12><color #black>When you create a **[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_62.png disciplined (or process,]]** like **[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_62.png Waterfall (BUFD),]]** Agile, Scrum, RUP, Kanban,
<i><size:12><color #black>DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE, etc.) organization then sometimes the discipline itself becomes
<i><size:12><color #black>a friction or hurdle for the organization to enter into active phase (achieving Higher level of <b>CMMI).
*<i><size:12><color #black>In other words, the **[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_62.png discipline]]** acts like a **silkworm** who kills itself by knitting a web of silk
<i><size:12><color #black>thread around himself and at the end silkworm can't come out & dies. Hence, Organization's
<i><size:12><color #black>**activism** is killed by <b>discipline (heavy weight process).
*<i><size:12><color #black>So while you're in **passive phase** keep the **[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_62.png discipline (process) light weight]]** so that members
<i><size:12><color #black>remain active.
*<i><size:12><color #black>So you can't be successful in active phase unless you fulfill the core prerequisites to enter
<i><size:12><color #black>in active phase.
*<i><size:12><color #black>So only introduce the discipline (moderate process) in the organization when you're at the level
<i><size:12><color #black>of entering into active phase.
*<i><size:12><color #black>Very few people have the capacity to bear the discipline (process) in an organization.
<i><size:12><color #black>Normal people can't bear (heavy weight process)!
*<i><size:12><color #black>When a new person join he/she has to abide by the law or (vision or ideas) of the organization
<i><size:12><color #black>otherwise he will be filtered out by the discipline (or process).
==|<i><size:12><color #black><b>Variety is the spice of life.|==
<i><size:12><color #black>When variety is vanished from the organization then:
*<i><size:12><color #black>All members of the organization 've skeleton or framework &
*<i><size:12><color #black>All of them 've **same thoughts and working patterns** & then resultantly they follow & resemble
<i><size:12><color #black>the life-cycle of a silkworm & die.
==|<i><size:12><color #black><b>What is the timeframe or for how long I should stay in passive phase?|==
<i><size:12><color #black>Well you can determine the **steps** that you require to get into **active phase.**
<i><size:12><color #black>You can also determine the needed core strength to get into **active phase.**
<i><size:12><color #black>but you can't determine the exact time required to complete these steps.
==|<i><size:12><color #black><b>Human vs. Machine|==
*<i><size:12><color #black>E.g. you can tell this is my factory & this is its capability & I can give this much production
<i><size:12><color #black>in a month. But in case of humans you can't say that. E.g. you can't make all the people in the
<i><size:12><color #black>world understand everything. <b>Human Resource is very strange phenomenon.
*<i><size:12><color #black>That's why we've fresh graduate, intern, professional, senior tags in <b>Software Development.
*<i><size:12><color #black>And team skills matter a lot in Software Development cost & time.
==|<i><size:12><color #black><b>You can't create a team without understanding human physiology|==
*<i><size:12><color #black>An organization can only provide infrastructure but it can't help in identifying what's your
<i><size:12><color #black>approach in individual capacity or what are your innermost beliefs. Self-awareness is of great
<i><size:12><color #black><b>importance. Making success a goal or making a materialistic conditions an ultimate
<i><size:12><color #black><b>goal is the real pitfall & trap.
*<i><size:12><color #black>**[[docs/3-programming-languages/Venkat-Subramaniam/images/img_62.png Process]]** can be **managed; people** can't be <b>managed.;
