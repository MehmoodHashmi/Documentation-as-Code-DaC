== Business Analysis Plan

A Business Analysis Plan is primarily a formal document that describes the major activities that need to be carried out by a Business Analyst during the project lifecycle. A business analyst prepares this document during the planning phase of the project scope. The people involved in this phase are the project managers, product owners and the business managers whose support is needed to execute this plan.

The Business Analysis Plan involves the following steps:

== Purpose of the plan
== Roles & Responsibility Distribution
== Tools Required to Execute the Project Plan
== Process & Techniques implemented to define the project
== Workflow & Process Mapping
== Adaptability & Measures to Implement Changes if Required
