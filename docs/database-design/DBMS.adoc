* *Entity:* an entity is a distinguishable object of DB.

* *Weak Entity:* is existent dependent that means, it has no primary keys, and it is dependent on another strong Entity For its identification.

* *Entity Set:* collection of entities of the same type

* *Attribute:* specifies part of an entity structure it is a mapping from an entity set to a domain of values. e.g.

* *Relationship:*  an association/mapping b/w entities.

* *Relationship SET:* an association/mapping b/w entity set.

* *Super Key:* a set of one or more attributes which, taken collectively, allows us to Uniquely identify an entity in an entity set.

* *Candidate Key:* a super key for which no  proper subset is also a super key.

* *Primary Key:* a candidate key chosen by the conceptual designer as the chief attribute Set by which an entity is identified in an entity Set.

The main difference between *Class Diagram and Entity Relationship Diagram* is that Class Diagram represents the classes and the associations among them in software, while an Entity Relationship Diagram represents the entities and their relationships between them in a database.

=== *1st Normal Form*
====

. Each cell to be Single valued, (but we've 2 at (2,1), (2,3))
. Entries in a column are the same type (int, char, string, etc. but we've different at (2,4), (2,5))
. Rows uniquely identified - Add Unique ID, or Add more columns to make unique

NOTE: The order of the rows and the order of the columns are irrelevant

=== *2nd Normal Form*
====
All attributes (Non-Key Columns) dependent on the #*key*# (Primary-Key)
====

Does not care who buys *(Alan Smith or Evan Wilson)* Xbox One the price will always remain the *same = 250*, so the key *(Primary key)* does not determine the "Price". So all the columns who do not depend on #*key*# have to be separated out. Like shown below.

Now the only problem is that we lost the *#transactions#* "we don’t know who bought what". So for that there needs to be a table called #*"junction table"*# like shown below.

=== 3rd Normal Form
====
All Fields (#*columns*#) can be determined Only by the #*Key*# in the *#table#* and, and no other *#column#*
====

.problem with 2nd Normal Form
image::images/image-2023-02-16-21-00-39-053.png[]

* Supplier phone number is repeated again & again

** As Sony will always have the same "supplier phone"

** As Microsoft will always have the same "supplier phone"

*** So to avoid duplication, do as shown below.

**** Now we will make change only in one place if needed in the future.

* Now this *"junction table"* is called the *#"compound key"#* as it is made of 2-columns.

.the table is in 3-rd normal form
image::images/image-2023-02-16-21-03-53-961.png[]

=== 4rth Normal Form
====
No multivalued dependencies

* Multivalued dependencies is a situation where a column like (*Newsletter*) can have different values (or different amount of values than other columns)
====

.problem with 3rd normal form
image::images/image-2023-02-16-21-09-29-167.png[]

* This is correct, but we've problem with  *Evan Wilson* because his name occurred twice.

** If *Evan Wilson* changes his address, I've to change it at 2-different places.
** What if he unsubscribes from anyone "*Newsletter*"

.the table is in 4rth normal form

Database normalization is a process of organizing the data in a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. There are several normalization rules, each with a specific purpose in organizing the data. Violations of these normalization rules can lead to data inconsistencies, update anomalies, and other problems.

=== Database Normalization violations
Here are some common types of database normalization violations, along with examples of each:

[arabic]
. First Normal Form (1NF) violations:

1NF requires that each table in a database has a primary key and that the values in each column of the table are atomic, meaning they cannot be broken down into smaller pieces. Some examples of 1NF violations are:

* Storing multiple values in a single column, such as a comma-separated list of items in an order.
* Creating a table with multiple repeating groups of columns, such as a table with columns for phone1, phone2, phone3, etc.

[arabic, start=2]
. Second Normal Form (2NF) violations:

2NF requires that each non-key column in a table is functionally dependent on the entire primary key. Some examples of 2NF violations are:

* Creating a table with a composite primary key, where some non-key columns depend only on a subset of the primary key.
* Creating a table with non-key columns that are not functionally dependent on the primary key.

[arabic, start=3]
. Third Normal Form (3NF) violations:

3NF requires that each non-key column in a table is dependent only on the primary key or other non-key columns, but not on any other non-key column. Some examples of 3NF violations are:

* Creating a table with transitive dependencies, where a non-key column depends on another non-key column, which in turn depends on the primary key.
* Creating a table with multiple candidate keys, where some non-key columns depend on only one of the candidate keys.

[arabic, start=4]
. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) violations:

BCNF requires that each non-trivial functional dependency in a table is a dependency on a superkey. Some examples of BCNF violations are:

* Creating a table with multiple overlapping candidate keys, where some non-key columns depend on only one of the candidate keys.
* Creating a table with functional dependencies that are not fully dependent on a superkey, such as a table with a composite key where some non-key columns depend only on one part of the key.

By identifying and resolving these normalization violations, you can ensure that your database is well-structured, easy to maintain, and efficient in processing data.
